From the moment you step into its snowy mountain setting, the game offers a fast-paced, physically engaging adventure that pushes the boundaries of VR gameplay. The player takes on the role of an unlikely hero battling an onslaught of interdimensional foes known as the \\u201cFracked,\\u201d which serves as the driving force behind the game\\u2019s relentless action sequences. While the story itself is fairly straightforward and primarily serves to propel you through the game\\u2019s various set pieces, it provides just enough context to keep the momentum going without slowing down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Fracked is its fluid and intuitive combat system. The game features a unique, fully interactive gunplay mechanic that allows for true 1:1 movement with weapons and a clever cover system that players can physically grab and move around with. This creates a level of immersion rarely seen in VR shooters, as you\\u2019re encouraged to think tactically\\u2014ducking behind cover, flanking enemies, and making use of a versatile arsenal of firearms. The combat feels natural and responsive, allowing for frantic firefights that never feel repetitive or stale. Coupled with this, the game\\u2019s enemies are varied and aggressive, requiring quick reflexes and strategic use of the environment to overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement in Fracked is where the game truly shines, setting it apart from many other VR shooters. The seamless integration of skiing down mountainsides, climbing walls, and ziplining through treacherous terrain adds a kinetic energy that keeps the experience fresh and exhilarating. The transitions between these movement types feel smooth and intuitive, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game\\u2019s dynamic world. This focus on physicality makes Fracked not just a test of shooting skills but also of spatial awareness and reflexes, demanding players stay physically engaged throughout their journey. It\\u2019s a thrilling blend of freedom and control that makes traversing the game\\u2019s environments as enjoyable as the combat itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, Fracked embraces a stylized art style that complements its high-energy gameplay. The environments range from pristine, snow-covered mountain landscapes to futuristic military installations, each crafted with an attention to detail that enhances immersion. The use of vibrant colors, dynamic lighting, and atmospheric effects helps establish a world that feels alive despite its post-apocalyptic setting. These visual elements, combined with the smooth frame rates and solid performance typical of nDreams\\u2019 VR titles, contribute to a comfortable and engaging experience that rarely breaks the sense of presence. However, some players might find that the art style leans more toward stylized aesthetics rather than photorealism, which may be a matter of personal preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Fracked excels in many areas, it is worth noting that its campaign is relatively brief, with most players completing the core experience within four to six hours. For those seeking a longer narrative or deeper story development, this may feel somewhat limited. The game\\u2019s plot focuses primarily on action and spectacle, with minimal character development or complex storytelling. This design choice keeps the focus firmly on gameplay but might leave players craving more in terms of narrative depth. Additionally, while the gameplay mechanics are polished, a few minor technical issues and occasional pacing quirks have been reported, though these are generally overshadowed by the game\\u2019s strengths.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Fracked delivers a compelling and energetic VR adventure that leverages its unique combination of shooting and movement mechanics to create an engaging and memorable experience. Its high-octane gameplay, immersive environments, and intuitive controls make it a standout title for VR enthusiasts looking for something beyond traditional shooters. While the story and campaign length may not satisfy everyone, the core gameplay loop provides plenty of thrills and challenges, making it well worth exploring for anyone who enjoys physically active and fast-paced VR games. Fracked is a testament to how VR can elevate action gaming by blending physicality with intense combat in a beautifully crafted world.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: 6/10|;|Was a fun, albeit repetitive 2.5hrs. You'll be one handing a few different weapons but mostly an SMG. All the enemies fight the same tho they introduce a mini-boss like heavy part-way thru. Checkpoint system can be infuriating, especially on the final act. Your hurtbox gets EXTRA wonky if you play in a large playspace because the game tracks your position in the world relative to a circle that's suppose to be underneath you. If you move too far away, you might take phantom damage - especially terrible once the game introduces explosives.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, if the trailer looks fun, I recommend this game! Def get it on sale, this could have been beat in 1.5hr if I didn't have such a hard time with the ending (because of the problems mentioned above)|;|Fracked, developed and published by nDreams, is an adrenaline-fueled virtual reality experience that expertly combines intense first-person shooting with innovative movement mechanics, including skiing, climbing, and ziplining.

The characters all have wonderful personalities. I havn\\'t been pushed away from any of the characters to feel a reason to dislike them. They all are very different, but it very much makes you really want to see how a relationship would be like with them.\\r\\nThe Main Character starts out kind of unreasonable but as the story progresses it makes more and more sense as to why they treat hero\\'s the way they do. It also isn\\'t something that is just ignored, the characters actually respond to how he reacts the way he does, it\\'s not an invisible issue to the cast, or appears to be unreasonable at the same time. \\r\\nI think this is a really good game, I hope the creator continues to make more. \\r\\n-Outstanding art\\r\\n-Like-able Characters\\r\\n-Simple but engaging story.|;|I\\'ve been waiting for Chardonnay Romancia since 2018, when the first sketches of Rud and Figaro where made, and started support the FANBOX since 2019, so i\\'m so happy it\\'s finally here.

The characters are super cute( as always, thank you Cotton!!) the plot its really good, the CGS are top quality, etc.\\r\\n As someone who is not really into Furry stuff, i highly recomend Cotton\\'s work!.

If you have enough money to spare then i say go for it but if not maybe wait till the story is finished. so far Jey Caroot has to be my favorite character absolutely based and despite the main characters attitude at the start hes actualy grown on me and i hope to see him  grow more as the story progresses|;|Non-stop, not quite slap stick, despite all the slapsticks, comedy with wonderful personalities that just feed off each other!  I\\'m glad to have bought and played it after Chapter 3 was released, Chapter 2 would have left me with too many unanswered questions.  There is still so much that could go wrong or right.  Despite all the pornographic content, the story doesn\\'t revolve around it, its supplemental to the many themes, and takes in depth looks about various feelings and perceptions people may have.  Struggling with the truth about oneself can be hard, and admitting it to others even more so.  Not everything is as easy and simple or difficult and hard as it may seem, emotions are complex.  Sometimes we must be forced into uncomfortable and unfamiliar situations to realize things we may not have ever considered in the first place.|;|Updates are really slow I must admit, but the game itself is nice and promising. i\\'m excited for when the 5th night update drops. Also Kinos is definitely my favorite character out of all of them, there\\'s just something with him that get\\'s my attention.|;|The story is interesting and well-planned. (Main character\\'s ability is wayy too powerful ;] ) Especially each characters have their own personality. (I personally LOVE LLOYDIE SO MUCH)\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though this game is not update frequently. (Which Im fine with it??) As I said, I Really recommend this game!!!|;|This game has so much potential with a good storyline and art (and also hot men) in it but unfortunately, the game hasnt been updated for a very VERY long time so if you dont really wanna take the risk of buying a dead game, I dont recommend buying it just yet!\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. Rudolf is such a cute little fox ;)\\r\\nAnother P.S. This game just got an update so go support the artist :D|;|First two chapters are really good! The setting of why MC get into \"troubles\" make sense for me. Now I\\'m looking forward to the following chapters get released, hope the wait won\\'t be too long...|;|I liked it.  The game both moved a bit too slow (on the AO  front, i was looking for something a bit more steamy) and a bit too fast on the story line front (some of the characters have \"pre-story\" relationships with the MC which took away from 1. getting to know them and 2. deciding if you actually liked them, rather than just being forced to by the story line.  Further more, the new characters you meet and interact with just LIKE you for no reason.  You dont have to win them over, or get to know them, let them get to know you..... it just insta chemistry which honestly is so unbelievable they had to put a story mechanic in place to explain it.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, the characters really are Likable and things do finally start to Warm Up at the very very end.  No idea if the creators are looking for feed back or not, but if they are Id suggest more investment in player choice where interactions with the other npc\\'s are involved and more things to get to know about those characters.  I want to Care about these characters, Not just because their \"cute\" and i wanna see em naked.  Also  more teasing and flirting please.  I\\'d like to see the MC showing their interest in the npcs and the npcs reaction to said interest.  In one simple phrase I guess I\\'d sum up my advise, as \"flesh out these characters please!\"|;|The game is wonderful, but I feel that it is crap that they sell you a game without completing it, finally, that they launch updates to advance the game is acceptable, but the last update is from July 16!!! I feel that the creator is not interested in this game or for a long time he just wanted to receive money or when the desire arises continue|;|While the overall story is good as is the art, the creator has not updated the game in more than a year and there is no indication that will change. Save your money unless the creator begins updates as currently it feels like just a ripoff.|;|way too short and its pretty costly compared to other vn but nice artwork though|;|I wonder if the game will include voice dubbing especially in the nsfw scenes if possible?|;|Looking forward to the sequel to this.  Great bara, furry art and a story which got me laughing.|;|Kinos and Garo are the best,Love the story and Everyone are lovely and cute ^^|;|I have been looking forward to this for the longest time~ I\\'m not disappointed at all they are all so adorable~ Every characters really grows on me in a lighthearted kind of way that I wanna hug everyone there~. I can\\'t wait for the updates~|;|Everyone else in the reviews was waiting on this, but it took me completely by surprise. How can you complain when a quality furry VN drops in your lap out of nowhere? I bought it without hesitation, and I don\\'t regret it.|;|Can\\'t wait for the upcoming chapters. Need my beloved furry men...!|;|Surprisingly this game has a good story for a hentai game.|;|It\\'s such a fun game to play. The story writting isn\\'t boring to read and every characters are very lovable. Wonder when the next chapter will be released.|;|love the story and characters, can\\'t wait for the next update!!!|;|This game is for furries who like big chested men :3\\r\\nFIGARO IS BEST BOY|;|never have I ever wanted to bottom and top at the same time for a single character|;|I know this game in 2020 by the demo ver and now it finally came out.

            " b'This is EXACTLY the kind of arcade racing \"blow em up\" game I like. If you liked the Twisted Metal on PS1 go a head and do yourself a favour....BUY THIS GAME!!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nPS. Devs, please add more content, id gladly buy more tracks via DLC!|;|This is a simple racing/shooting hybrid based on classic games like Atari\\'s Badlands (arcade) and Super NES games RPM Racing (Radical Psycho Machines), Rock \\'N\\' Roll Racing and, more recently, Death Rally that\\'s about finishing first while blowing up other racers.\\r\\nThere really isn\\'t too much content yet (only 4 tracks with some variations and 4 playable vehicles at the start) but it\\'s fun and-in single player mode-challenging, but it\\'s much more fun if you\\'ve got friends to play with. Not the kiddies though, as there is some NSFW language (occasional F-bombs). It looks good with a nice metal soundtrack and controls are surprisingly realistic, you can\\'t just go all out around corners or you might roll over, let alone go off track.\\r\\nWhile I\\'m hoping there will be more content either added or unlocked as I play through, it\\'s decent for the price and has the makings of a good party game. Just a slight thumbs up so far based mainly on single player and seemingly light amount of content/variety but if you like this type of game then it\\'s a fine pickup at a good price.|;|its just not good man, theres exactly 4 tracks(acid, lava,desert train and ice) which each have day/night and forward/reverse variations , 4 vehicles (car,jeep,buggy and truck) with custom colors, and ingame theres 5 weapons(rocket,mine,shield,fire and nos) alongside a default machine gun with infinite ammo, and thats about it, the whole game\\r\\n\\r\\nits just too few content, even with the very low price, you can experience the whole game in 15 minutes\\r\\n\\r\\nthe start of each race is everyone shooting its machinegun at the cars at the front, instantly blowing them up, just too chaotic, and not in a fun way\\r\\n\\r\\n the physics are pretty unpredictable and fun but thats about it\\r\\n\\r\\nif you buy, have in mind that its very short, if you have someone to play with, you can have fun for about an hour or so, but thats it, i recommend buying gas gusslers extreme instead, way more tracks, way more vehicles, way more weapons, theres a cooldown before you can shoot your weapon, and in general a more complete and similar experience|;|Pretty fun game.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeems that 2 players will be Horizontal Split Screen; seems that LOCAL COUCH can only be 2 players?\\r\\n\\r\\n<CONTROLS>\\r\\n[Y] Toggle Camera (3rd Person <> Top Down)\\r\\n[A] Fire\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly 4 tracks, that can be driven day or night, and tracks can be reversed -- is it worth $1?

            "Original:  b'It\\'s a good game. I love the characters and the overall quality is amazing. However, I just can\\'t recommend this game at its current state. The game is incomplete and ends at chapter 3, while the game hasn\\'t been updated for a whole year. I know making VN is a time consuming task but they could have at least marked this as early access. I\\'d wait for the developer to start updating the game again before purchasing.|;|Only 2 chapters isn\\'t enough! I want more!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, is the current state of the game a ripoff?\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsolutely not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an adult VN that delivers quickly and bountifully, and the story has substance and suspense with some amazing art if you\\'re not here for some quick relief. If you like bara kemo (gay manly furries, for the non-weebs) works, this is a must buy!|;|Good graphiques and story but INCOMPLETE. The game end at the middle of the story, no update since 1 year.|;|Typically I don\\'t play BL or Furry related games but surprisingly I\\'m actually glad this is one thats intertroducing me the genres. The art style is very good, and I personally think that is going to be a major part of judging it. The characters all are very loveable and the art style is adorable. The characters all have wonderful personalities. I havn\\'t been pushed away from any of the characters to feel a reason to dislike them. They all are very different, but it very much makes you really want to see how a relationship would be like with them.\\r\\nThe Main Character starts out kind of unreasonable but as the story progresses it makes more and more sense as to why they treat hero\\'s the way they do. It also isn\\'t something that is just ignored, the characters actually respond to how he reacts the way he does, it\\'s not an invisible issue to the cast, or appears to be unreasonable at the same time. \\r\\nI think this is a really good game, I hope the creator continues to make more. \\r\\n-Outstanding art\\r\\n-Like-able Characters\\r\\n-Simple but engaging story.|;|I\\'ve been waiting for Chardonnay Romancia since 2018, when the first sketches of Rud and Figaro where made, and started support the FANBOX since 2019, so i\\'m so happy it\\'s finally here. The game is amazing, as i expected! The characters are super cute( as always, thank you Cotton!!) the plot its really good, the CGS are top quality, etc.\\r\\n As someone who is not really into Furry stuff, i highly recomend Cotton\\'s work!. Everything he makes it\\'s always amazing! So please, play Chardonnay Romancia! You won\\'t regret it! :D\\r\\n(Btw, Nazk= best husbando, no cap)|;|this game so far has an interesting story and i cant wait for it to finish. If you have enough money to spare then i say go for it but if not maybe wait till the story is finished. so far Jey Caroot has to be my favorite character absolutely based and despite the main characters attitude at the start hes actualy grown on me and i hope to see him  grow more as the story progresses|;|Non-stop, not quite slap stick, despite all the slapsticks, comedy with wonderful personalities that just feed off each other!  I\\'m glad to have bought and played it after Chapter 3 was released, Chapter 2 would have left me with too many unanswered questions.  There is still so much that could go wrong or right.  Despite all the pornographic content, the story doesn\\'t revolve around it, its supplemental to the many themes, and takes in depth looks about various feelings and perceptions people may have.  Struggling with the truth about oneself can be hard, and admitting it to others even more so.  Not everything is as easy and simple or difficult and hard as it may seem, emotions are complex.  Sometimes we must be forced into uncomfortable and unfamiliar situations to realize things we may not have ever considered in the first place.|;|Updates are really slow I must admit, but the game itself is nice and promising. i\\'m excited for when the 5th night update drops. Also Kinos is definitely my favorite character out of all of them, there\\'s just something with him that get\\'s my attention.|;|The story is interesting and well-planned. (Main character\\'s ability is wayy too powerful ;] ) Especially each characters have their own personality. (I personally LOVE LLOYDIE SO MUCH)\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though this game is not update frequently. (Which Im fine with it??) As I said, I Really recommend this game!!!|;|This game has so much potential with a good storyline and art (and also hot men) in it but unfortunately, the game hasnt been updated for a very VERY long time so if you dont really wanna take the risk of buying a dead game, I dont recommend buying it just yet!\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. Rudolf is such a cute little fox ;)\\r\\nAnother P.S. This game just got an update so go support the artist :D|;|First two chapters are really good! The setting of why MC get into \"troubles\" make sense for me. Now I\\'m looking forward to the following chapters get released, hope the wait won\\'t be too long...|;|I liked it.  The game both moved a bit too slow (on the AO  front, i was looking for something a bit more steamy) and a bit too fast on the story line front (some of the characters have \"pre-story\" relationships with the MC which took away from 1. getting to know them and 2. deciding if you actually liked them, rather than just being forced to by the story line.  Further more, the new characters you meet and interact with just LIKE you for no reason.  You dont have to win them over, or get to know them, let them get to know you..... it just insta chemistry which honestly is so unbelievable they had to put a story mechanic in place to explain it.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, the characters really are Likable and things do finally start to Warm Up at the very very end.  No idea if the creators are looking for feed back or not, but if they are Id suggest more investment in player choice where interactions with the other npc\\'s are involved and more things to get to know about those characters.  I want to Care about these characters, Not just because their \"cute\" and i wanna see em naked.  Also  more teasing and flirting please.  I\\'d like to see the MC showing their interest in the npcs and the npcs reaction to said interest.  In one simple phrase I guess I\\'d sum up my advise, as \"flesh out these characters please!\"|;|The game is wonderful, but I feel that it is crap that they sell you a game without completing it, finally, that they launch updates to advance the game is acceptable, but the last update is from July 16!!! I feel that the creator is not interested in this game or for a long time he just wanted to receive money or when the desire arises continue|;|While the overall story is good as is the art, the creator has not updated the game in more than a year and there is no indication that will change. Save your money unless the creator begins updates as currently it feels like just a ripoff.|;|way too short and its pretty costly compared to other vn but nice artwork though|;|I wonder if the game will include voice dubbing especially in the nsfw scenes if possible?|;|Looking forward to the sequel to this.  Great bara, furry art and a story which got me laughing.|;|Kinos and Garo are the best,Love the story and Everyone are lovely and cute ^^|;|I have been looking forward to this for the longest time~ I\\'m not disappointed at all they are all so adorable~ Every characters really grows on me in a lighthearted kind of way that I wanna hug everyone there~. I can\\'t wait for the updates~|;|Everyone else in the reviews was waiting on this, but it took me completely by surprise. How can you complain when a quality furry VN drops in your lap out of nowhere? I bought it without hesitation, and I don\\'t regret it.|;|Can\\'t wait for the upcoming chapters. Need my beloved furry men...!|;|Surprisingly this game has a good story for a hentai game.|;|It\\'s such a fun game to play. The story writting isn\\'t boring to read and every characters are very lovable. Wonder when the next chapter will be released.|;|love the story and characters, can\\'t wait for the next update!!!|;|This game is for furries who like big chested men :3\\r\\nFIGARO IS BEST BOY|;|never have I ever wanted to bottom and top at the same time for a single character|;|I know this game in 2020 by the demo ver and now it finally came out. Its worth to wait, such a good game ^^\\r\\n|;|Liking it so far, Can\\'t wait for the updates!! XD|;|It\\'s some good tongue in cheek humorous smut vn, innit?|;|Waiting for Episode 4 it\\'s very good game|;|It\\'s hard to focus while playing it with only one hand.|;|Lloydie...

Not the kiddies though, as there is some NSFW language (occasional F-bombs). It looks good with a nice metal soundtrack and controls are surprisingly realistic, you can\\'t just go all out around corners or you might roll over, let alone go off track.\\r\\nWhile I\\'m hoping there will be more content either added or unlocked as I play through, it\\'s decent for the price and has the makings of a good party game. Just a slight thumbs up so far based mainly on single player and seemingly light amount of content/variety but if you like this type of game then it\\'s a fine pickup at a good price.|;|its just not good man, theres exactly 4 tracks(acid, lava,desert train and ice) which each have day/night and forward/reverse variations , 4 vehicles (car,jeep,buggy and truck) with custom colors, and ingame theres 5 weapons(rocket,mine,shield,fire and nos) alongside a default machine gun with infinite ammo, and thats about it, the whole game\\r\\n\\r\\nits just too few content, even with the very low price, you can experience the whole game in 15 minutes\\r\\n\\r\\nthe start of each race is everyone shooting its machinegun at the cars at the front, instantly blowing them up, just too chaotic, and not in a fun way\\r\\n\\r\\n the physics are pretty unpredictable and fun but thats about it\\r\\n\\r\\nif you buy, have in mind that its very short, if you have someone to play with, you can have fun for about an hour or so, but thats it, i recommend buying gas gusslers extreme instead, way more tracks, way more vehicles, way more weapons, theres a cooldown before you can shoot your weapon, and in general a more complete and similar experience|;|Pretty fun game.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeems that 2 players will be Horizontal Split Screen; seems that LOCAL COUCH can only be 2 players?\\r\\n\\r\\n<CONTROLS>\\r\\n[Y] Toggle Camera (3rd Person <> Top Down)\\r\\n[A] Fire\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly 4 tracks, that can be driven day or night, and tracks can be reversed -- is it worth $1?
