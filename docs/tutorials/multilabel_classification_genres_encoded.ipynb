From the moment you step into its snowy mountain setting, the game offers a fast-paced, physically engaging adventure that pushes the boundaries of VR gameplay. The player takes on the role of an unlikely hero battling an onslaught of interdimensional foes known as the \\u201cFracked,\\u201d which serves as the driving force behind the game\\u2019s relentless action sequences. While the story itself is fairly straightforward and primarily serves to propel you through the game\\u2019s various set pieces, it provides just enough context to keep the momentum going without slowing down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Fracked is its fluid and intuitive combat system. The game features a unique, fully interactive gunplay mechanic that allows for true 1:1 movement with weapons and a clever cover system that players can physically grab and move around with. This creates a level of immersion rarely seen in VR shooters, as you\\u2019re encouraged to think tactically\\u2014ducking behind cover, flanking enemies, and making use of a versatile arsenal of firearms. The combat feels natural and responsive, allowing for frantic firefights that never feel repetitive or stale. Coupled with this, the game\\u2019s enemies are varied and aggressive, requiring quick reflexes and strategic use of the environment to overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement in Fracked is where the game truly shines, setting it apart from many other VR shooters. The seamless integration of skiing down mountainsides, climbing walls, and ziplining through treacherous terrain adds a kinetic energy that keeps the experience fresh and exhilarating. The transitions between these movement types feel smooth and intuitive, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game\\u2019s dynamic world. This focus on physicality makes Fracked not just a test of shooting skills but also of spatial awareness and reflexes, demanding players stay physically engaged throughout their journey. It\\u2019s a thrilling blend of freedom and control that makes traversing the game\\u2019s environments as enjoyable as the combat itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, Fracked embraces a stylized art style that complements its high-energy gameplay. The environments range from pristine, snow-covered mountain landscapes to futuristic military installations, each crafted with an attention to detail that enhances immersion. The use of vibrant colors, dynamic lighting, and atmospheric effects helps establish a world that feels alive despite its post-apocalyptic setting. These visual elements, combined with the smooth frame rates and solid performance typical of nDreams\\u2019 VR titles, contribute to a comfortable and engaging experience that rarely breaks the sense of presence. However, some players might find that the art style leans more toward stylized aesthetics rather than photorealism, which may be a matter of personal preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Fracked excels in many areas, it is worth noting that its campaign is relatively brief, with most players completing the core experience within four to six hours. For those seeking a longer narrative or deeper story development, this may feel somewhat limited. The game\\u2019s plot focuses primarily on action and spectacle, with minimal character development or complex storytelling. This design choice keeps the focus firmly on gameplay but might leave players craving more in terms of narrative depth. Additionally, while the gameplay mechanics are polished, a few minor technical issues and occasional pacing quirks have been reported, though these are generally overshadowed by the game\\u2019s strengths.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Fracked delivers a compelling and energetic VR adventure that leverages its unique combination of shooting and movement mechanics to create an engaging and memorable experience. Its high-octane gameplay, immersive environments, and intuitive controls make it a standout title for VR enthusiasts looking for something beyond traditional shooters. While the story and campaign length may not satisfy everyone, the core gameplay loop provides plenty of thrills and challenges, making it well worth exploring for anyone who enjoys physically active and fast-paced VR games. Fracked is a testament to how VR can elevate action gaming by blending physicality with intense combat in a beautifully crafted world.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: 6/10|;|Was a fun, albeit repetitive 2.5hrs. You'll be one handing a few different weapons but mostly an SMG. All the enemies fight the same tho they introduce a mini-boss like heavy part-way thru. Checkpoint system can be infuriating, especially on the final act. Your hurtbox gets EXTRA wonky if you play in a large playspace because the game tracks your position in the world relative to a circle that's suppose to be underneath you. If you move too far away, you might take phantom damage - especially terrible once the game introduces explosives.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, if the trailer looks fun, I recommend this game! Def get it on sale, this could have been beat in 1.5hr if I didn't have such a hard time with the ending (because of the problems mentioned above)|;|Fracked, developed and published by nDreams, is an adrenaline-fueled virtual reality experience that expertly combines intense first-person shooting with innovative movement mechanics, including skiing, climbing, and ziplining.
