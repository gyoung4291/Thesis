From the moment you step into its snowy mountain setting, the game offers a fast-paced, physically engaging adventure that pushes the boundaries of VR gameplay. The player takes on the role of an unlikely hero battling an onslaught of interdimensional foes known as the \\u201cFracked,\\u201d which serves as the driving force behind the game\\u2019s relentless action sequences. While the story itself is fairly straightforward and primarily serves to propel you through the game\\u2019s various set pieces, it provides just enough context to keep the momentum going without slowing down the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Fracked is its fluid and intuitive combat system. The game features a unique, fully interactive gunplay mechanic that allows for true 1:1 movement with weapons and a clever cover system that players can physically grab and move around with. This creates a level of immersion rarely seen in VR shooters, as you\\u2019re encouraged to think tactically\\u2014ducking behind cover, flanking enemies, and making use of a versatile arsenal of firearms. The combat feels natural and responsive, allowing for frantic firefights that never feel repetitive or stale. Coupled with this, the game\\u2019s enemies are varied and aggressive, requiring quick reflexes and strategic use of the environment to overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement in Fracked is where the game truly shines, setting it apart from many other VR shooters. The seamless integration of skiing down mountainsides, climbing walls, and ziplining through treacherous terrain adds a kinetic energy that keeps the experience fresh and exhilarating. The transitions between these movement types feel smooth and intuitive, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game\\u2019s dynamic world. This focus on physicality makes Fracked not just a test of shooting skills but also of spatial awareness and reflexes, demanding players stay physically engaged throughout their journey. It\\u2019s a thrilling blend of freedom and control that makes traversing the game\\u2019s environments as enjoyable as the combat itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, Fracked embraces a stylized art style that complements its high-energy gameplay. The environments range from pristine, snow-covered mountain landscapes to futuristic military installations, each crafted with an attention to detail that enhances immersion. The use of vibrant colors, dynamic lighting, and atmospheric effects helps establish a world that feels alive despite its post-apocalyptic setting. These visual elements, combined with the smooth frame rates and solid performance typical of nDreams\\u2019 VR titles, contribute to a comfortable and engaging experience that rarely breaks the sense of presence. However, some players might find that the art style leans more toward stylized aesthetics rather than photorealism, which may be a matter of personal preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Fracked excels in many areas, it is worth noting that its campaign is relatively brief, with most players completing the core experience within four to six hours. For those seeking a longer narrative or deeper story development, this may feel somewhat limited. The game\\u2019s plot focuses primarily on action and spectacle, with minimal character development or complex storytelling. This design choice keeps the focus firmly on gameplay but might leave players craving more in terms of narrative depth. Additionally, while the gameplay mechanics are polished, a few minor technical issues and occasional pacing quirks have been reported, though these are generally overshadowed by the game\\u2019s strengths.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Fracked delivers a compelling and energetic VR adventure that leverages its unique combination of shooting and movement mechanics to create an engaging and memorable experience. Its high-octane gameplay, immersive environments, and intuitive controls make it a standout title for VR enthusiasts looking for something beyond traditional shooters. While the story and campaign length may not satisfy everyone, the core gameplay loop provides plenty of thrills and challenges, making it well worth exploring for anyone who enjoys physically active and fast-paced VR games. Fracked is a testament to how VR can elevate action gaming by blending physicality with intense combat in a beautifully crafted world.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: 6/10|;|Was a fun, albeit repetitive 2.5hrs. You'll be one handing a few different weapons but mostly an SMG. All the enemies fight the same tho they introduce a mini-boss like heavy part-way thru. Checkpoint system can be infuriating, especially on the final act. Your hurtbox gets EXTRA wonky if you play in a large playspace because the game tracks your position in the world relative to a circle that's suppose to be underneath you. If you move too far away, you might take phantom damage - especially terrible once the game introduces explosives.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, if the trailer looks fun, I recommend this game! Def get it on sale, this could have been beat in 1.5hr if I didn't have such a hard time with the ending (because of the problems mentioned above)|;|Fracked, developed and published by nDreams, is an adrenaline-fueled virtual reality experience that expertly combines intense first-person shooting with innovative movement mechanics, including skiing, climbing, and ziplining.

            "reviews:  [b'I love games like The Madness of Little Emma where you play a run at a time and try to get farther and farther, defeat difficult bosses, unlock powerful and fun items, and discover secret areas and challenges. This game fits that mold fairly well, but I can\\'t recommend picking up this game for a number of reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Unbalanced Items: The majority of items you will come across are pretty useless and sometimes (I\\'m not sure what determines this) picking up items increases your Madness stat by 1, a stat which makes the game harder. I\\'m not sure how exactly the difficulty increase works; I\\'m not sure if it scales with your Madness level or just increases the difficulty once you hit a certain threshold, but this mechanic encourages the player to pass up on most items due not only to their unhelpful effects, but due to the negative consequences of picking up a large number of items over time. That being said, there are a select few items that are really, really good. If you manage to find a combination of two or three items that work super well together, they can carry you for an entire run.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stats rely on RNG: This is a pretty common aspect of similar games, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work very well in The Madness of Little Emma. Your main source of stat boosts (which you won\\'t get very far without many of) are random Herbs scattered throughout the game. Sometimes they drop from enemies, sometimes you get them for clearing a challenge/arena room, sometimes you get them from treasure chests. Regardless of how you get them, there is a major flaw to this mechanic: the most common Herb type (green) has a chance to lower your stats. With how rare all Herbs are and with how quickly the difficulty of this game picks up, you need as many stat upgrades as you can possibly find, so not taking green Herbs isn\\'t a reliable option. You get one guaranteed purple Herb (increases a random stat) per boss fight, but sometimes that\\'s all you\\'ll get on the first floor, which to me is an instant restart. And it\\'s even worse when that stat upgrade happens to be Luck instead of Damage or Fire Rate. Some items will grant stats too, but, as mentioned above, a lot of items you\\'ll come across are simply not worth taking.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Run Ending Rooms: When you get farther in (floors 6+ usually), you can run into rooms that will completely ruin you if you don\\'t have an incredibly overpowered item loadout. Most normal enemies aren\\'t a problem, but get a room of the wrong champion enemies and there\\'s little you can do. The worst champion effects are explosive shots, slowing aura (which sometimes comes with another champion effect), and double damage shots, and these can be especially bad if you get a room with a lot of champion enemies, which honestly isn\\'t too uncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Unavoidable Damage: When you start playing this game you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run into a ton of this, but the farther you get in the game the higher the chance you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come across rooms where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much going on there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legitimately nothing you can do to maneuver out of the way of enemy attacks. Even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re completely overpowered (minus one combination of 2 items that actually completely breaks the game in your favor), run ending rooms are still likely to beat you up a little bit. The game tends to be pretty generous with dropping hearts for the player to pick up, but then you could enter another room where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re guaranteed to take damage and it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have really helped much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are my main gripes with this game, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough to make the game almost entirely unfun. Other than what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve listed, I have had the game crash on me once, but I did have it open for about 7 hours straight before that happened so that could easily have had something to do with it. In any case, there is definitely some fun to be had here, and I actually really love the Arena mode a whole lot, but the main game itself becomes incredibly painful to play. The difference between The Madness of Little Emma and many other roguelikes is that skill and knowledge of items/enemy patterns can only get you so far; you have to be incredibly lucky to have a shot at making real progress in this game. Because of this dependence on luck, you can try to get a good run started for hours and still not get anywhere, and then suddenly have two perfect items fall into your lap one after the other that will grant you a win.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interested in trying out this game, it has been pretty heavily discounted in the past and I would assume it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely to be on sale again at some point. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still on the fence about picking it up, with the Steam refund you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a two hour window of opportunity to try it out for yourself a bit and see if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up enjoying it more than I did, so I do encourage anyone interested to at least try the game before writing it off. Furthermore, there is a demo for this game available on Steam to try out without any worries of refunding. I would definitely recommend starting with the demo version.|;|The Madness of Little Emma is one of the few rogue-likes that caught my attention and didn\\'t let go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt certainly has lots of things in common with other rogue-like games, but it feels completely different. Mainly due to the fact that this is a platformer with rather satisfying movement physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game has a good learning curve: it doesnt tell you anything about its mechanics, you have to play, observe and note the changes. First couple of hours i had difficulty getting past 1st stage, 60 hours later the main reason for not reaching the 5th or 6th ending is that i made some mistake early on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely TMoLE has some rough edges, for example the cursor is somewhat bleak and sometimes i lose it in the background. But the developer is constantly working on the game, fixing bugs and adding new free content.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion: a great game for its price, challenging but rewarding.|;|This is a perfect example of everything an imitator game should be. It\\'s obviously \"The Binding of Isaac as a platformer\", but it successfully captures the mood, feel, fun and design philosophy of Isaac. The madness mechanics and the item pool do a good job capturing the feel of Isaac without feeling like a rehash. There\\'s great music, great enemy and boss design, varied items, and tons of secret levels. And oh yeah, it\\'s fun and really does feel like you\\'re playing a new version of Isaac.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: Game balance isn\\'t perfect for some items, characters, champion enemies and bosses. Neither is Isaac\\'s, but this game definitely occasionally has me going \"that room wasn\\'t fair\" while Isaac didn\\'t. Also, it\\'s hard to tell what some items do.|;|Take the theme and collectibles of Binding of Isaac, mix it with the 2d platformer aspect of Spelunky or Rogue Legacy; and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve pretty much got The Madness of Little Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some rooms and bosses can get downright bullet-hell-esque with the amount of fire they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re throwing at you, and even some fairly early enemies can be extremely vicious \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially ones that make quick leaps at you, potentally trapping you in a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe items you pick up tend towards passive bonuses, allowing for vicious stacking combos (if you get lucky, anyway \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plenty of dud items, although I have yet to find anything actively negative like accidentally picking up Soy Milk or Cursed Eye in Isaac.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music is good, and the pixel graphics work pretty well.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportantly, as of this writing (September 29th), the game is 80% off \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a mere $1.79. At that price, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great pickup for anyone who enjoys rogue-like/light/platformers/any of the games that I mentioned in my first sentence.|;|This is how it should be done. Instead of shoving your money up the arse of some early access scum buy this game. I bought in on release day, played through it, had a good time. But that was not it, the Dev Dude keeps updating it as frequently as I get disappointed by early access games. And that\\'s about once a week. I could see how the game improved with every patch, and now its better than ever before. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo that guy published a finished, perfectly fine game and now he even keeps updating it with new totally free content. Its sad that there only so few people who are playing it. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you love rogue like as much as I do, then this is a must buy. Give the Dev Dude you god damn money!|;|If I were grading on concept alone this is probably an \"A\" for me. That concept being that of a roguelight twin stick platformer featuring a seedy cartoon atmosphere and tons and tons of unlockables.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously heavily influenced by the Binding of Isaac everywhere from concept to theme to mechanics all the way down the line. No suprise to find it\\'s still a winning formula her even while I wish it was more original in some aspects it\\'s still a fun ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would say the underlying platforming/shooter mechanics are solid but not spectacular. To elaborate on that point a bit I just feel that the running around shooting etc. feels functional here as opposed to spectacularly fluid or satisfying.  Luckily the vast number of unlockables and different playstyles and upgrades makes the experience a plus 1 and the fact that I got this for just under 2 bucks makes me smile and shake my head at some of my other purchases.\\r\\n\\r\\n6/10|;|Really good music and I like the unique Binding of Isaac adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the movement alone is enough to deter me away from playing this game. It is beyond clunky. I really had high hopes because I love Binding of Isaac and this is similar, except in platformer format, but the movement need to be smoother for me to pick it up again.|;|UPDATE: Since the recent patches, I now no longer continue to have the problem when trying to open the game.  It will now open from Steam and the desktop, so that was fixed pretty quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, the game is influenced by other Rogue-like titles such as Isaac, but the one thing that this game doesn\\'t do is hold your hand.  A 2D rogue-like platformer that easily can stand as one of the tougher rogue-likes on the market.  From the couple of hours I\\'ve spent in the game, hardly do I even come CLOSE to seeing any 1 of the 4 endings mentioned.  Little Emma requires skill, simply put.  You\\'ll get damage ups, but the enemy placement and mini boss rooms range from \"easy to dodge\" to \"this room is the WORST\".  Some of the late game mobs, including these crying women who start bombarding you with explosions that are hard to track, are just a pain to deal with, if you even make it that far with no damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a bad game though?  Absolutely not because it\\'s still a very interesting rogue-like.  The story involves two children, Emma (oldest) and her little brother Timmy, who survive pretty much on their own.  One day, Emma wakes up to find Timmy missing as well as blood all over the room.  As she looks around, she notices a trap door (similar to Isaac\\'s adventure into the depths below) under a rug.  Assuming Timmy has been taken or wandered down there, she soon follows.  As far as story, it\\'s not strong.  I mean it holds a very similar take of the Isaac story that people have accustomed themselves to, but instead of a hateful mother, you\\'re the loving big sister.  Whether Timmy went down there on his own is still unknown.  Still having a hard time beating it once, I know nothing about the endings.\\r\\n\\r\\nControls are pretty standard and easy to understand at least for mouse and keyboard.  The room you spawn in shows you your controls.  A to move left, D to right, W to jump (as well as space), and D to go down platforms you can jump through.  You can also use the arrow keys for these commands as well.  You can also rebind keys if you have a more comfortable control scheme.  To use activation items, you press E.  Activation items, unlike space bar items in Isaac, require money to use instead of having to clear rooms.  It is here to prevent any of the items from seeming too overpowered, such as an item that freezes everything in the room or turns back time by a couple of actions.  You aim with your mouse, left click to shoot balls of spit and right click to drop bombs.  It\\'ll be best to have a mouse that you can change sensitivity on because there are moments where it\\'s hard to connect your hits.  While the keyboard controls are fine, the controller support is less desirable, even though it\\'s still supported.  Every time I\\'ve tried to play with the controller, I just put it back down because it feels weird.  You also don\\'t have as much freedom with aiming than you do with a mouse.  You also can\\'t rebind controller buttons, so right now whatever your buttons are mapped to, that\\'s what you\\'ll have to deal with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst offender of this release is the current technical issues.  Some issues, like what I\\'m having, is I can\\'t open the game from Steam or desktop.  I simply have to go into my steamapps, common, find Little Emma, and open up the \"Win\" batch file.  That then opens up a command window and does it\\'s thing before the game opens.  Slightly sloppy and a small hassle to play a game.  You also need Java installed for some reason.  These issues don\\'t prevent me from still enjoying the game, but I can understand why people buying and installing would be confused as to why their game doesn\\'t open.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, Emma is still an enjoyable experience if you\\'re looking for a rogue-like that is a little more tougher and requires more skill than RNG.  RNG still matters, of course, but it\\'s almost treated like it\\'s a second thought instead of a primary mechanic.  This game will not hold your hand, it will not pay you kindly with optimistic words of victory.  It will wreck you and frustrate you, but not because it\\'s unfair; because you require the skill to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead.  If the previous negative remarks about this game get fixed, it\\'ll only continue to show how valuable this game is to the rogue-like genre.|;|Yes, this game is very, VERY derivative of several games, to the point where the intro made me think \"Is this Binding of Isaac told from Mom\\'s perspective?\" at first. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut you know, theme and general feel aside...Derivative or not, sometimes you have to respect solid craftsmanship. This is VERY nicely done. Definately worth a look.|;|TL;DR - Despite some of its flaws, low budget, and how heavy-handedly it draws from its obvious inspirations, Emma is a competently made game with enough fun and unique ideas to make it a worthy addition to the rogue-like-like genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs someone with over 1000 hours in the Binding of Isaac games, I\\'ve been curious to try the Madness of Little Emma for awhile now, since Isaac appears to be its most obvious influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m writing this review of my initial impressions of the game after only having played a few runs, with my latest being a fairly decent one (I made it to \"Misery\" and managed to clear some sort of Love-themed optional dungeon).  I\\'m not sure how close to the end I made it, but I feel I experienced enough of the game to give me a good idea of what kind of experiences I can expect  from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the game draws heavily from its Isaac inspiration, the most obvious difference is its side-on perspective and the inclusion of some basic platforming elements.  If Isaac is a variation on Zelda-type dungeon crawling, Emma is a variation on Metroid.  The movement feels good - due to the game\\'s focus on bullet-hell type enemies (more so than Isaac even), the ability to jump, dodge, and weave between enemy bullets is crucial, and game controls quite well in that regard.  While I normally prefer to play platformers with a controller (and the game does kind of support it, but not very well), mouse and keyboard seems to make the most sense for this game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art style is quite dark, and lacks the silly gross-out humor found in the Binding of Isaac.  Most of the early enemies are just some gnarly insects, but some of the later enemies are downright Lovecraftian masses of eyeballs, slime and sinew.  Though there is some humor in the game, most of it seems pretty straight-faced and grim, and the music, which is mostly subdued and atmospheric, adds to that aesthetic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spirit of the gameplay is very much like Isaac.  Players play as Emma or one of several unlockable characters and traverse procedurally-generated dungeon maps.  Maps are randomly populated with a series of rooms - upon entering a room, the doors lock behind you until all the enemies have been cleared.  Also like in Isaac, death is permanent, and each run starts you over from scratch aside from any unlockables you managed to get from your previous run.  The enemies themselves seem quite varied in both appearance and attack abilities.  Some fire bullets in a wide range of patterns and effects, some chase you down in varying ways (through walls, divebombing from the sky, teleporting across the room, etc), some spawn other enemies, some fire beams, and some are, frankly, just hard to describe - I\\'m actually tempted to say there might even be more individual enemy variety in this game than in Isaac.  In addition to enemies, some rooms have chests of varying quality (brown, gray, gold, and red in rare cases) some of which require a bomb to open.  The are also spike traps, and bombable walls, secret rooms, and occasionally colored herbs which grant the player stat buffs (or debuffs) when consumed, sort of like pills in Isaac.  Each floor contains one treasure room which randomly draws from a large pool of stat/ability altering items (over 250), one boss room, and sometimes one or more \"special rooms\" like a sacrifice room (sacrificing health/consumables for herbs [maybe items?]), Arenas (fighting off waves of enemies for loot), Shops (which contain herbs, chests, and a creepy hooded skeleton man who doesn\\'t understand the meaning of \"personal space\"), and what I call \"Hanging Rooms\" which feature a girl hanging by a noose who drops an item when you shoot her.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOf the items I\\'ve found so far, some seem familiar, and some unique.  In my last run I found an item which caused friendly ghosts to spawn around me and chase down enemies (like blue flies in Isaac), a helpful robot friend that orbited my body and shot down enemy projectiles with a laser, an item which made my \"tears\" larger and stronger when I stood still, and an item that made me fart enemy-stunning perfume.  It\\'s not yet clear to me whether or not Emma features the same level of item synergy found in Isaac, though I would assume it does to some degree or another.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is only superficially similar to that in Isaac.  While Emma also fires white tear-like projectiles (or maybe it\\'s spit?), the high movement speed, ability to jump, and the 360 degree aiming makes for a much faster and potentially more hectic experience than in Isaac.  After the first few floors, the bullet hell aspects of this game seriously ramp up - whereas Isaac is more focused on predicting enemy shots and carefully placing yourself between them, Emma seems to require more twitch reflexes and simply running the fuck away from situations when they get too hairy.  The later levels can become seriously overwhelming in that regard, so much so that I find it difficult to imagine that player should be expected to be able to dodge all of the shots instead of simply taking it on the chin and using your (generous) invincibility frames to better position yourself around some cover.  On the one hand, this seems somewhat reasonable despite the game being fairly withholding when it comes to health and especially health upgrades, on the other, one of the things I love so much about Isaac is the predictability of enemy attacks and being able to avoid damage simply by being smart.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBosses are also a big part of the game, and so far I\\'ve only found a couple that remind of those from Isaac.  One was a segmented snake monster that bounced around the room, the other was a big face that split into multiple smaller faces when enough damage had been dealt to it.  So far, other than those two, I haven\\'t seen any others which immediately reminded me of Isaac bosses.  That said, I can\\'t say I found most of the bosses I fought to be particularly fun or compelling.  One was a giant fly that lazily glided around the room occasionally popping out two smaller flies that would each fire a single projectile (and small flies dropped hearts, which seemed unnecessary given how easy the fight was).  In the optional Love-themed dungeon I stumbled across, the boss was a large heart that bounced around the room spewing out bullets in an octagonal pattern, which would split into more large bullet-spewing hearts as it got damaged, repeating this process until 8 or so of these large hearts had been defeated.  Of the bosses I encountered, my favorite was called Entozoon, who looked like a giant demented Pez dispenser and flew off-and-on the screen spewing bullets and carpet-bombing the room, requiring some interesting dodging to avoid being hit.  While admittedly I haven\\'t even seen half of the bosses in the game yet, I\\'m a little disappointed in the boss rooms, which so far have been empty rectangular rooms that don\\'t seem to take advantage of one of the game\\'s main mechanics - the platforming.  You\\'re mostly just running back and forth across the floor dodging projectiles and hopping over the bosses when they get too close.  There\\'s no verticality to fights from what I\\'ve seen (though, again, it\\'s possible I just didn\\'t get to see those fights).  On the later levels the game somewhat manages to remedy this by spawning bosses in the normal rooms which makes more a much interesting fight.  I just wish platforming had been more of a consideration for those early boss fights to keep them from feeling so dull.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, aside from my complaint about boss fights, and a few bugs I noticed during the screen transitions, I quite enjoyed my time with this game.  Emma manages to wear its inspiration on its sleeve without being overshadowed by it and has its own unique brand of fun charm.  Fans of the Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, or even Terraria will probably find more than a little to love here.|;|I don\\'t have much to add that others haven\\'t already said.  It\\'s got a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac, but as other reviewers have noted, it doesn\\'t feel like a rehash.  There are a handful of new and interesting ideas in the game, and there\\'s more than enough content to entertain you for a dozen or more hours - much more if you want to see what the unlocks are, find new power ups, and see the various endings.  There are unfair moments that will frustrate you, and the rare bug (in 150 or so times i\\'ve done a playthrough so far, i\\'ve had 3 games where a bug prevented me from continuing), but overall the game feels pretty good - even if maybe it\\'s a bit unbalanced at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s disappointing that more people haven\\'t snagged this game - i think it\\'s much better than the numbers are indicating (only 94 reviews as of this post).  Maybe some folks are turned off by the $8.99 price - i think i got it on sale for just a couple dollars myself.  But my opinion on that might be a special case, since i don\\'t buy any games over 10 bucks as a rule (after all, i have about a hundred games i haven\\'t even installed yet - anytime i think i want a game more than $10, i remind myself of that fact!)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy strongest endorsement of the game is simply my number of hours in game - 64 at this point, and still going.  That being said, i don\\'t feel like the replay value is anywhere near Binding of Isaac - but maybe that doesn\\'t really say much, since i have about a thousand hours in that game across the original + rebirth + afterbirth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you like difficult platformers that have tons of things to unlock and discover, then this is certainly worth a try.  If you do decide to buy this, try to give it a couple of hours before your verdict - my own opinion of the game has only improved with more playthroughs...|;|An amazing game, all it\\'s own once you get past it\\'s similarities with other games.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve played this a fair bit, and stream it often, and intend to carry on doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it\\'s obvious that it\\'s heavily influenced by other games, such as The Binding Of Isaac, the creater has clearly defined this as a seperate game, adding other mechanics not see in similar games, differentiating it from the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy it immensely, the game having huge replayability, and a ton of unlockables (with more to come, hopefully).\\r\\n\\r\\nChallenging and fun, people really need to give this more than a few minutes playing and complaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan\\'t wait for more updates.|;|Basically, Binding of Isaac as a platformer - downright to the dark setting, artwork and general gameplay. If you liked binding of isaac and like platformers, you\\'re going to enjoy this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that can be bothersome are the controls. I\\'ve never been a fan of platformers with mouse aim, so if you are bothered by it, you better maybe playing something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the game is a little rough on the edges: the trasition between the screens sometimes can cause a shaky effect on the screen because the camera goes up and down really fast a couple times before settling in the new character position. Also, the game over screen could be a little more flashed out, instructing the player to press any key to go to the main screen (I found myself waiting for visual feedback every time I died lol)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut nonetheless, is a fun game. Like I said in the beginning, if you like BoI and platformers, you\\'re going to like this game for sure.|;|This game really wants to be The Binding of Isaac.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a good amount of effort put into making it and I did find myself wanting to keep playing at times, but it really lacks polish. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter movement feels a bit too fast for precision but too slow to navigate some of the more obnoxiously designed rooms with way too many walls that form labyrinthian paths to the next room.\\r\\n \\r\\nCharacter progression feels slow and unrewarding, and you\\'ll feel underpowered in most runs. There\\'s a pretty large pool of items but so many of them have underwhelming effects so the few items that the game gives you in an average run barely give you any power. Too many similar status effect modifiers and worthless active items, and not enough damage. The game is so stingy that you\\'ll be lucky if you find a damage up after two floors. It doesn\\'t help that a lot of enemies are really spongy. There\\'s even a few items that are so bad that they can end a run on their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant number of chests spawn on top of large rows of spikes and low ceilings so you\\'re pretty much guaranteed to lose life trying to get the items inside.  There\\'s also chests that are only reachable by bomb jumping. The game does not drop enough hearts to compensate for the forced damage chests. It\\'s usually not even worth it to try since chests barely give anything good. A lot of them only give 1 coin or 1 half-heart.\\r\\nConsumables don\\'t drop enough in general. You only get enough coins in a typical run to maybe buy two items from shops, and that\\'s only if you avoid using active items altogether, which have coin costs that can go up to 4 coins per single use. There\\'s an optional secret area that only spawns if you\\'re holding 50 coins and you\\'ll most likely never see it unless you play the character that starts with 30 coins and still avoid buying items.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome enemies and projectiles are hard to see in some of the later areas. Red orbs on a dark orange background or pale homing skulls on a light brown background, and the same skulls also look exactly the same as some projectiles that are created by player items so you don\\'t even know which are good and which are bad sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nArena challenge rooms can spawn enemies a few pixels away from you so you have no time to react, or even directly on your character if you\\'re playing the flying character. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe flying character gets stuck on slopes instead of moving along them. \\r\\n\\r\\nMultisegmented bosses can have a trawl effect on each segment that instantly wipes out your entire inventory of consumables. Regular enemies can have that modifier, too, so you tend to lose your bombs and coins a lot but at least you have a chance to save a coin or two in regular rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mouse isn\\'t locked to the game window in Windowed Mode. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can\\'t rebind the bomb key for some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nA room in an early area that can spawn a dozen high HP mobs in a small space that fly through walls closing in on you, is almost guaranteed death on most characters. There\\'s bullet hell rooms that are near impossible to survive in, made worse by your imprecise movement. Mini bosses with modifiers that can immobilize you in said Bullet Hell rooms. There\\'s a bunch of rooms in general that feel like trollish traps that are almost guaranteed to end a run. You can\\'t skip them, and it wouldn\\'t matter anyway because you don\\'t know which rooms are death traps until you enter them. 90% of the rooms in this game are brain dead easy and a dozen or so that are so ridiculous that you\\'ll lose 5 full hearts just trying to get a couple hits in.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnemy bullets have infinite range but your character\\'s shot range is very short. Sometimes it\\'s impossible to even get near an enemy because there\\'s 3 or 4 enemies near the ceiling that never stop shooting an absurd amount of projectiles, and you\\'re just stuck in a corner inching back and forth to dodge the unending barrage of projectiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a lot more fun in the separate Arena mode than the main mode since it\\'s a lot more generous with its items and buffs, not to mention you get a choice of multiple items instead of getting stuck with whatever garbage RNG throws at you in the main mode. There\\'s item synergies and special item interactions in this game but you\\'d never know if you only played the main mode. Finding all four Monster familiars combines them into a single, larger familiar, \\xc3\\xa0 la Isaac\\'s Super Bum, that shoots large piercing lasers, for example. It feels like a lot of secrets are tied to RNG.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of these complaints were minor nitpicks but there\\'s definitely a lot of unfair or unpolished design that sours the entire experience. A lot of my deaths felt like they weren\\'t my fault, and most runs aren\\'t very fun because the game refuses to give you any damage buffs. The game could be really good with some more development time and proper balancing but I can\\'t recommend it in its current state. It seems development has ended, though.|;|Really fun and well made. I love the art style, the sound effects, the items and characters (my favourite is Elizabeth, because she\\'s OP). I wholeheartedly recommend this to any rogue-like fans!|;|I was quite happy to see this gem made it to steam and bought it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a rather obvious hommage of The Binding of Isaac and it\\'s influences. You\\'ll recognize a lot of things quickly, if you are familiar with BoI. There is, however, a crucial difference: The Madness of little Emma is a platformer, which adds a refreshing spin to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are already plenty of items in this game and it is possible to see what they do by pressing Esc and going into the items menu, which removes a bit of the guessing game and makes it easier to learn the ropes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the enemies are concerened, most patterns are easy to learn, though, not surprisingly, there are some that need some getting used to, as well as those that very likely need some tweaking. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s also an insanity meter in this game. The higher it goes, the faster enemies become and the earlier more difficult ones/variants spawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally, I only experienced a glitch and one crash/freeze, but I\\'m fairly confident that those will be fixed/tracked down quickly, since a look at the discussions shows that the dev is communicating closely with the community to get rid of those problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis game also comes with a very good soundtrack as far as I am concerened, so all in all I heartily recommend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally: This is my first review, so i hope I managed to touch upon the important points.|;|A great game! Kind of short, but it\\'s just the right amount of time for a busy, working-class guy, like myself. I\\'m very happy with this purchse. I know everyone has said a lot of good things about this game so I\\'d like to point out something different:\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that really annoys me about platforming games, rouge-like ones in particular, is when the dev doesn\\'t take the time to get the running/jumping/platforming mechanic solid. This game achieves that very well. You move around the screen at a good pace, not too fast not too slow. You won\\'t find yourself running into damage because your character failed to react to your movements. Also you don\\'t continue to slide around after running/jumping. I rarely found myself getting frustrated at not being able to reach a ledge and at no time was it due to my character just continuing to move and fall off due to bad mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\nBig kudos on nailing the basics of gameplay! A lot of devs tend to overlook that.|;|Edit: Changed some of the wording and updated it a little bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madness Of Little Emma is a nice little action platformer. If you\\'re a fan of The Binding Of Isaac (TBOI) it should kind of feel familiar as it is heavily inspired by it at times. Normally, I don\\'t write reviews, but this game has so few players that I feel I have to.\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]What is The Madness Of Little Emma?[/u]\\r\\nThe Madness Of Little Emma is an 2D action platformer set in a dark world. As in TBOI you have one \"item room\" on every floor, there are sacrifice rooms - though they\\'re not working like the ones in TBOI - shops, dare rooms, secrets and some more. You also have to beat a boss at the end of the floor to go down deeper and deeper until you reach the final boss.\\r\\nBut most things still are working quite different than in TBOI. So TMOLE isn\\'t just an \"TBOI as an action platformer\", but is its own game and has its own appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]What could be better:[/u]\\r\\n- [b]Items[/b]\\r\\nSome items are really good and fun to play with, but most of the items don\\'t really help you or worse make your run worse. While TBOI also had the same kind of items, I feel that they had more use.\\r\\nAfter having played some more I don\\'t think the items are that big of a problem anymore. I probably expected too much of them, but unlike in TBOI in this game most items won\\'t make your run. TMOLE relies more on the skill of the player than having great items which doesn\\'t mean that good items can\\'t save your run.\\r\\nExample for \"bad\" items: I was really disappointed in the shuriken, it looked really nice in the trailer, but when I obtained it, it just felt bad. Having to fight enemies with a shield is pure horror, as you can hit them twice mostly or even just once and you have to wait for the shuriken to return to you before you can throw it again, while their shield is back up.\\r\\nExample for \"good\" items: The raven. I just love that little ugly bird. He can fly through walls and instantly attacks the first enemy in sight while you can still shoot and he does quite some damage. Always nice to have and it makes the run much easier.\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]Neutral:[/u]\\r\\n- [b]It\\'s hard[/b]\\r\\nLike really really hard. Maybe even harder than TBOI. But that\\'s ok, I like challenging games. After having said that, you can still beat the \"endboss\" on your first day playing. The good thing is, that this game doesn\\'t end there. It more or less just begins.\\r\\nI also like the fact that you can control the hardness by collecting madness from items or the hanged girl. The more madness you have, the harder the game gets. Like TBOI elite enemies also get a lot more common, if you beat the \"endboss\" the first time.\\r\\nBut there are things right now that I feel are to difficult. Of course it could be my limited skill, but I find most of  the elite bosses to hard. For example elite Liquid Sisters are taking up 2/3 of the bossroom and the bubbles they shoot, which explode into more shots, are taking the rest of the room. Some bosses are easier than others and you have to get used to most of them and even then it\\'s still a challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]What\\'s good:[/u]\\r\\n- [b]Leaderboard[/b]\\r\\nYou gain points by how well you played and by how far you could go in your playthrough. Note that every playthrough counts as long as you play the ladder mode. The Ladder gets reset every two weeks (at the time I\\'m writing this review).\\r\\n[i]Edit: It seems like the ladder wasn\\'t resetted since i wrote this review the first time.[/i]\\r\\n- [b]RNG/ randomly generated dungeons including which items, rooms, shops etc you get[/b]\\r\\nEvery new run just feels kind of unique and refreshing. You always want to find out, which item you get on the floor. But even though I love that there are 250 items in the game - some of which you have to unlock -, if you haven\\'t unlocked enough it feels like you get the same items again and again. Maybe it\\'s just me, but I get baseball glove like 50% of my runs.\\r\\n- [b]No tutorial-ing[/b]\\r\\nYou get to know the basics of the game and thats it. Not even the specialties of the characters you can unlock are explained, so you have to find everything out yourself (or use the wiki). It feels like starting TBOI all over again and I love it.\\r\\nIf you want to get into this game, I suggest you check out the official beginner guide by the creater, Hugeowl. You can find it in the steam guides, it explains the basics and helps a lot for the start.\\r\\n- [b]Active Items[/b]\\r\\nI just like how they work. Most of the time you have to pay some small amount to use the item. In TBOI it would probably suck, but here it works really well.\\r\\n- [b]Unlocks[/b]\\r\\nLike TBOI there are different endings, items, bosses etc to unlock. I love unlocking things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all TMOLE is a fun indie game and it still gets patches from time to time, so it has the potential to get better and better. It may not be a flawless game and sometimes even a little bit too hard, but if you have fun with TBOI you pretty sure will have fun with TMOLE. Also, supporting an indie developer feels nice.|;|The Madness of Little Emma. Even though it was heavily influenced by The Binding of Isaac, gameplay is very different. Well, it\\'s obvious because Emma is a platformer game.\\r\\nAlthough the game is a bit unpolished at this moment, it\\'s still very enjoyable. The most noticeable thing is that there\\'s no much variation in room layouts. Of course they\\'re different from level to level, but you can see the same layout on the same level pretty often. But oh well, it\\'s just a matter of time.\\r\\nOf course, it\\'s really hard and you may need a bit of a time to get used to it. Especially it\\'s important to get used to spikes - they\\'re a major game element.\\r\\nThe music is pretty nice. Episode 3\\'s theme is probably my favorite.|;|Although I enjoy this game, I don\\'t feel like it offers much more than many of the other rogue-lights I\\'ve played. I feel like its good, but I don\\'t feel like its for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, that doesn\\'t mean its not for you. It\\'s definitely fast paced, has an enjoyable environment and atmosphere, and requires some point awareness at times. \\r\\n\\r\\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. Not for me, but I wouldn\\'t tell you not to try it.|;|Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, calling The Madness of Little Emma a clone of The Binding of Isaac would be giving it too little credit. It very obviously draws heavy influence, using a very similar HUD, (almost) identical means of attacking and even all but reusing some of the enemies and bosses from TBOI, including directly borrowing names (I\\'m looking at you, Haunt). Despite the striking resemblance to Isaac, the platformer aspect helps to keep the gameplay fresh. [i]It helps to think of The Madness of Little Emma as what it is, a standalone game, and not as an Isaac clone.[/i] The side view as opposed to a top-down view offers possibilities for interesting items and enemies, such as giving your shots weight allowing you to shoot in arcs, and the Twin Sisters boss which drops from the ceiling above you. Jumping around to dodge enemies and shots is difficult and a little frustrating at first, but I enjoy it more and more as I play. The knife-throwing enemies on the third floor are surprisingly fun to fight in narrow hallways with ceilings just low enough to evade damage with a well-timed jump.\\r\\n\\r\\nAesthetically, The Madness of Little Emma really shines. The Binding of Isaac has some of my favorite concepts for bosses (The Cage, The Lamb), and even though I\\'ve only seen early-game bosses and enemies as of the writing of this review, Emma does a fantastic job of being more creepy and less cartoony. The mass of eyeballs that can be found on the third floor that make that wonderfully creepy sound when they split and the first chapter boss \\'The Haunt\\' that floats around menacingly with that horrific smile (think that weird distorted smiledog.jpg picture) are two of my favorite examples. The dark color palette looks great and I love what little I\\'ve heard of the soundtrack thus far. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, The Madness of Little Emma is a fun little game that I\\'m definitely glad I bought. I won\\'t say that it\\'s better or worse than Isaac, I\\'ll just say it\\'s a fun standalone rogue-like that I would definitely recommend.|;|I was on the fence for positive/negative on this one... I\\'m going thumbs down.  <aside>Why don\\'t we get a scale 1-5 or something, Steam?  C\\'mon!</aside>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s like the creator wanted to make Binding of Isaac, but that was already done:\\r\\n* Play in a series of increasingly deep basement rooms and floors? Check.\\r\\n* Lots of random power-ups that can have synergistic effects? Check.\\r\\n* Big Boss to fight at the end of the floor? Check.\\r\\n* Body fluids as weapons? Check.\\r\\n* Treasure chests, coins, and bombs? Check.\\r\\n* Shops with undead shopkeepers? Check.\\r\\n* Sad and creepy back story and enviroment? Check.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be fair, the creator has said s/he was inspired by TBOI, but I just don\\'t find this game as fun.  Some things I don\\'t like:\\r\\n* Your main weapon is <i>spit</i>.  Yes, you happily spit at your enemies, not the sad tears of TBOI.  To me this is just weird.\\r\\n* Your shot range is about 1/4 the screen width, but enemy shots fly across the entire room.  This cannot be improved (at least that I\\'ve seen so far except by one or two powerups).  You can get hit by an enemy that died eight seconds ago.\\r\\n* Edit 2/26 addition: A consequence of the previous point: if the shot doesn\\'t move very quickly (happens with some enemy types) or at all, the shot will stay on the screen for a VERY long time.  Beyond all reason.  Waiting for you to touch it.\\r\\n* TBOI is played as a top-down view of rooms.  TMOLE is played as a side view of rooms with platforms.  Jump, jump, jump.  I don\\'t find this fun, maybe you will.\\r\\n* F*cking spikes everywhere.  You can prevent damage if you jump up from them quickly.... once.  After that they are extended, good luck getting past them.  Half the treasures are spike puzzles, or you just can\\'t get them unless you want to die for them.\\r\\n* To compensate for all the spikes, there is a ghost character (Elizabeth) that can fly and shoot through (some) barriers and is not affected by spikes.  This character has some limitations such as increased damage received, but I can\\'t seem to enjoy playing with any other character.\\r\\n* Edit add 2/26: Elizabeth can shoot \"ghost\" spit through most barriers, unlike the non-dead chars.  She can also fly.  This compensates for the platform craziness required of other chars, but some of the items you pick up nullify her advantages.  E.g., bouncy spit prevents her normal ability to spit through barriers the enemies can\\'t.  Many other items are useless (e.g, she can already fly so catching that item doesn\\'t help.)  Hope you have that item catalog handy!\\r\\n* Most rooms are too dim to easily see the walls.  You can get stuck because you can\\'t see the dim wall stopping you while you are trying to get away from enemies.  Did you die unexpectedly?  Oh, that slightly less black wall in the already noisy background was there.\\r\\n* Items are just random and weird and often not helpful.  If you don\\'t remember what the item does, too bad (e.g., the one that drops your fire rate really low).  There is a catalog, but finding the item in the list before you touch it is not easy.  Once you pick it up it becomes part of a separate list (but too late if it\\'s bad).\\r\\n* Edit add 2/26: The game seems to confuse \"hard\" with \"impossible\".  A hard game would require more skill to succeed in, but some rooms are just absolutely impossible.  Bullet hell with bullets all moving at different speeds, and your char speed is way too fast to reasonably maneuver in the tiny intervals between them.  Or enemies with insane advantages (I\\'m looking at you, brown liquid sisters.)\\r\\n* The occasional, infuriating, unexpected crash to desktop.  I was having a good game, too!!\\r\\n* The painful rare but not-impossible punishment of having your luck dropped to zero.  Majorly reduced chance of bombs, coins, and hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some interesting creativity to differentiate it:\\r\\n* Arena rooms give a reward after surviving a fight.\\r\\n* Edit add 2/26: Arena mode is a way to learn about many items that otherwise you only occasionally encounter.\\r\\n* Sacrifice rooms give a reward for giving up health, bombs, and coins.\\r\\n* Special and secret levels: beehive, dark tunnel, space, others.\\r\\n* Creative enemy types, even if most have analogues in TBOI.\\r\\n* Unique and consistent, distinct art style\\r\\n* Good music\\r\\n\\r\\nBuy it if TBOI is not enough for you.  But get that one first.|;|Let me start out by saying I\\'ve had lots of fun playing this game and I still am! This game has so many items and hidden rooms I\\'m still unlocking them and trying to figure out how everything works. I can say hands down I would recommend this game to just about anyone, it\\'s not a serious hard core game but it\\'s cute and unique in it\\'s own creepy way. Even though I\\'ve been played the game for a while now it\\'s not that repetitive at all, each dungeon is completely unique offering different items, bosses, and secrets making each run Really fun or just fustraiting. 10/10 Great buy|;|Fun roguelite game to sink some hours in, is a challenge, but fun to master. I have yet to even see all the items yet and I look forward to finding more combinations!|;|I\\'ve played almost 50 hours of this game, so I guess I\\'m qualified to review it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s pretty great. 8.5/10 you should buy it. The only thing I have against it is its difficulty- despite played it for 50 hours, I\\'ve only unlocked the first ending. You\\'d think I\\'d reach the others by now, but nope. What\\'s particularly cruel to me is the ladder mechanic; dying early in the game can make my ladder score go down by thousands of points, which is a serious rage quiter :( it discourages experimentation and induces rage. The game does have a \"casual mode\" that allows you to play without touching the ladder score, but that takes out the fun of trying to raise it and doesn\\'t really reward experiementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall though, the atmosphere, story, randomization is really good. I give 8.5/10.|;|I greatly recommend The Madness of Little Emma for anyone who likes rogue-lites and challenging games with tons of replayability.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like this game.\\r\\nAlthough heavily inspired, it manages to be unique and inventive. After playing a lot of Rebirth and getting a bit bored with it, I found The Madness of Little Emma to soothe the craving while not being just more of the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely worth the price, too. There is a surprising amount of content and a great deal of replay value. It always feels exciting to figure out what an item does, to finally kill a boss or to find yet another secret. Also, I love the music.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if I like the game visually but that\\'s not what I\\'m here for. There are so many good things about this game that it would be silly to judge it just by it\\'s looks, which aren\\'t too bad anyways.|;|so I played this game a few hours and I must say that its definitely worth the money.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Addictive ... because you want to go further and find new items see new enemys etc\\r\\n- Good music\\r\\n- Nice design\\r\\n- Leaderboard ( I am currently place 25 )\\r\\n\\r\\nonly thing I dont like are the spiky things on the ground sometimes its a bit unfair to reach some treasure chests ^^\\r\\n\\r\\nbuy it ! :)|;|Imagine Binding of Isaac except as a platformer and you pretty much have this game. Unfortunately some aspects of a game  don\\'t work nearly as well in platformer form as it does Legend of Zelda style and it clearly shows in this game. There\\'s some original ideas. It\\'s more horrorcentric and if you want a roguelike that is a bit more dependent on skill rather than memorization, this will fit the bill, but expect a much greater difficulty than in Isaac.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately that difficulty increase doesn\\'t feel intentional. Spikes that seem to be meant to push up if you stand on them too long, damaging you, seem to switch to the \\'stab\\' state too quickly to really utilize this as a mechanic and you can easily get treasure screwed early on because of their placement. Similarly, many of the items you can get are useless or actively detrimental to your gameplay. Once I got flight and was like \\'woo flight\\'--in Binding of Isaac this was one of the best items you could get but in this one it\\'s actually awful and many of the traits you can get are like this. \\'Great in Isaac, awful in a platformer\\'. While there were subpar items in Isaac, you could often make use of all of them in certain situations but some of the items in this game are legitimately just pointless to have around or only really detrimental to your play (like the flight option that has such a slow leadup time you\\'re likely going to get hit). If you didnt\\' have to hold down spacebar to stay afloat it might have been a much more useful item.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeating the first chapter wasn\\'t that hard but once I got to story 2 I couldn\\'t progress much further as a cheap enemy comp would generally destroy me. \\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly the pacing is a lot slower. You can\\'t just rush a backtrack like you can in Isaac. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn short the difficulty spike is too much and frankly the difficulty spike rarely seemed fair. The bosses seem to be well designed but the rooms themselves hardly and the story from what I\\'ve seen--hardly original or curious.|;|Wow I\\'m unexpectedly impressed. This game is actually really good!\\r\\nPros:\\r\\n+Like Binding of Isaac, the powerups you get are very relevant and gamechanging (unlike EtG imo)\\r\\n+The art looks really good. Little critters fill the rooms and bring them to life\\r\\n+The music is also really good. Very reminiscent of BoI also.\\r\\n+There are secrets galore. The wiki is really lacking at the moment, so a lot of things about the game feel like a mystery. This is a plus to some and a con to other, but I find it kind of refreshing that the game feels so unexplored and new right now. This is one of my favorite things about the game.\\r\\n+You can click on the menu to find out what items do. You dont need to look up items in your inventory\\'s effects on a wiki.\\r\\n+The seplechur miniboss is super interesting\\r\\n\\r\\nCons (These cons are all very very small nitpicky things, the pros are a way bigger deal):\\r\\n-Jumping feels a little too floaty to me. Becomes a non-issue once you get used to it.\\r\\n-One of the bosses so far (I think it was the haunt) can get into situations where its impossible to dodge their attack. This is very likely the players fault though. He\\'s too tall to jump over, so if he charges you and you aren\\'t positioned right so that he charges horizontally, then you cant dodge. \\r\\n-Spikes come up a little too fast imo. I am disincentivised to ever try grabbing chests on them because I always take damage.|;|Cute little rogue-lite. Cool concepts, but gameplay is slippery and too repetitive.|;|Nice game with good procedural generation. Lots of endings. Unfortunately, it\\'s very difficult to get every of them.|;|The game is such a cool. In it have a lot of mystery and for this I like it so much. The soundtrack is great. In it have and a lot of items which is ather cool think in the game.|;|At first I had a negative impression of this game due to the lack of controller configuration options, but was contacted bya developer who told me how to manually change the controller mapping through the steam files and now I can play the game just fine, actually a very fun game.|;|I changed my mind; Short version:\\r\\nA game that combines elements of shooters like Turrican and The Bonding of Issac into a promising experience that needs some work\\r\\nThe game is still improving, and the developer is quick to respond to complaints with kindness, even my former scathing review\\r\\nLoads of content, neat ideas under the hood, but...\\r\\nNeeds patience to work with, and requires manually editing a config file to adjust control pad controls, which isn\\'t great, but since I tweak my Fallout/Elder Scrolls ini files, I can\\'t really complain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, it\\'s a neat little game that I hope the developer continues to improve, because it\\'s got lots of potential.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong Version:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I recently wrote a review for The Madness of Emma wherein I went a bit away from my usual review style and into griping about one thing that bugged me and letting it ruin my experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s... not who I want to be, although it apparently IS who I am, so let\\'s see if, in honor of New Years and the swift response from the developer, I can\\'t give a better review. To be clear, this is a complete re-write.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current game feels more like a Beta - the features are there, but they need some refinement and tweaking. To get the negatives out of the way:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The main character looks a bit odd and seems to be doing the Full-Exorcist-Twist sometimes when shooting\\r\\n- The default gamepad controls are just not great, and to fix them you have to edit a config file - but that\\'s really easy to do, and you should probably play with keyboard and mouse anyway (despite my personal peccadillos).\\r\\n- A lot of the environments feel kinda empty\\r\\n- There are only two fullscreen resolution options, and one of them is a resolution I haven\\'t seen since I lost my netbook, so that\\'s... weird\\r\\n\\r\\nBut don\\'t stop reading there - I have a lot of good things to say!\\r\\n\\r\\n+ The developer responded to my original review within a couple hours to tell me how to fix my biggest issue (the control scheme) - I love a developer who responds so quickly and with such grace to criticism, so kudos there!\\r\\n+ The game itself is pretty fun - combining platforming with the rogue-lite formula that made Binding of Isacc amazing is a great idea, and the game itself plays well\\r\\n+ The voice acting and opening scenes are creepy and very well done\\r\\n+ There is enormous variety to be found in this game, with weapons, power-ups, bosses, and room designs. Moreso than a lot of similar projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, The Madness of Little Emma is unpolished. It needs work and could do with better config options and some minor improvement to the pixel art. It\\'s not perfect... but who the hell cares - it\\'s a fun, dark romp that gets better the more you play it. I\\'m still not convinced that it\\'s worth the $9 US asking price, but if you can get it on sale, you absolutely won\\'t regret it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m personally looking forward to continued updates (they seem to hit about every other month, which is a pretty good pace), and I plan to log several more hours with the game. Give it a chance - it\\'ll grow on you!|;|I\\'ve re-written this review due to some very helpful feedback from the developer (see the comments on this review). My initial post was done in a fit of annoyance because the keyboard control was too difficult for me, and although the game detected my controller on OSX the bindings were all wrong and I couldn\\'t see any way to change them. This has now been resolved (again, see comments) and for me the game is much better with a controller.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly though, just the simple fact that the developer was willing to respond helpfully to someone whingeing about a game that they paid \\xc2\\xa30.59 for in the xmas sale automatically makes this recommended. The game itself is pretty good too though!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a roguelike platformer with a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac, which is fine with me because BoI:Rebirth is one of my all-time favourite games. There are unlockable characters, 100\\'s of passive and active pickups, and special/secret rooms (which I\\'ve only scratched the surface of so far). The platformer aspect does give it a different feel from BoI, and it\\'s not quite as polished as that game, but it\\'s overall a very solid game. I\\'ve played a lot of different roguelikes and this is one that I think I\\'ll be playing for quite a while to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nTLDR; Fun game, awesome developer, recommended!|;|The game does borrow a lot from Binding of Isaac, but that fact is misleading. The game, at its core, is a hard bullet hell platformer, and that quality is more important to the game than any similarities is has to Isaac. It\\'s also made with love, even if it\\'s a bit rough around the edges. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes challenging platformers and bullet hell games.|;|I\\'m sure I have a few hundred casual hours left out of this game for the few bucks I payed for it, and while I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever come close to beating it yet, I love it.  It\\'s like a platformer version of Binding of Isaac, which is awesome and unique enough to stand up on it\\'s own.  It\\'s also a lot more challenging too.  Definitely worth it if you like roguelikes at all.|;|First of all, yes, this game is a shameless rip off of Binding of Isaac, even down to things such as music style, boss names and shooting \"spit\" instead of tears. Does this mean it\\'s a bad game? Not at all. If you enjoy BOI you will most likely enjoy this game as well. It has nice art style, smart enemy AI and interesting level design, not to mention plenty of items and secrets to explore. I happened to get it on sale for 2 dollars which was a fantastic price and a good deal. Would I have purchased it at its regular price? Most likely not, I would have just stuck with playing Binding of Isaac. However if you\\'ve 100 percented Isaac and are looking for very similar tribute game, this is a good choice, and is probably the best Isaac clone I have played so far. Obviously if you were not a fan of BOI, don\\'t get this game. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy main complaint about it is the controls. While you are allowed to change the key bindings, aiming and firing is strictly locked to the mouse, which makes playing this game difficult if I am not at home with a physical mouse I can attach to my laptop. If you don\\'t have a physical mouse it makes the game basically unplayable. It would also be nice if it had xbox controller compatibility, however a simpler fix would just be to allow the firing and aiming to be relocated to the keyboard as it is in BOI, creating a smoother gaming experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinal Conclusion? Tired of playing BOI or finished with it and want something similar and engaging? Get this game\\r\\nOtherwise wait for it to go on sale again or skip it.|;|This game plays similar to games like Raze and Fubar: 2d, one hand on wasd to move and another on the mouse to shoot and it manages to keep the same feel as binding of isaac, though it doesn\\'t end up with your character looking widely different from what you started with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re rocking older graphics cards, avoid running the game in fullscreen, it\\'ll crash like no tomorrow.|;|Honestly, whoever made this game made sure no one will enjoy it. it\\'s ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult. The way the story unfolds is amazing and for those who say it\\'s a knockoff of the binding of Isaac, i think it\\'s much better however, it needs more work done, a lot of things don\\'t make any sense. I\\'m certain if the developer takes the suggestions from the players and improves it, a lot of people will enjoy it.|;|Oh, The Madness of Little Emma!\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid game! Still has some kinks to work out but definitely enjoyable. Very difficult and requires more practice than I\\'ve yet put in. I\\'m not going to do a pro/con list, but if you want to hear my extended thoughts on the game, I made a little video you can watch:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0AjRowb4oQ&feature=youtu.be|;|The premise of the game is good but that\\'s where it ends there. It\\'s hindered by a lot of trail and error and I\\'m not just describing playing the game and losing and trying again. When you start the game, you\\'ll get a keyboard showing the controls however you\\'ll later encounter various objects which could be used but then how would I use them? The openning screen doesn\\'t explain that. I had to find that out in the options tab.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe satifying to shoot but you\\'ll encounter the tiny creatures like the spiders and flies but they can\\'t be shot at, they can however be run into which kills them in a gross way, which is confusing. Then there are the floor boards which have a dotty texture on them but they turn out to be spikes which harm the characters. Also trial and error collecting some items as they harm you. which seems pointless, a little too late type of mechanic. Not really nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game offers an item gallery which displays all the items you\\'ve found in the menu but it\\'s just for show. Would have been nice if this was made for in game just in case the player encounters the same items again.|;|Probably the best roguelike on steam.  I would say a cross between the splenky type platformer with the rest influenced from Binding of Isaac and it works very well.  Tons of powerups, great music, and the random generation does a great job.  Bravo!|;|I bought this on sale because the reviews were screaming \"ISAAC CLONE!\". My logic was that I love the Binding of Isaac enough that I\\'d love a clone. Faulty logic, would rather be playing Isaac.|;|This game is simply awesome! \\r\\nI will write this one clearly: it is inspired to The Binding of Isaac or Our Darker Purpose (both wonderful games btw) the same way Salt and Sanctuary is inspired to Dark Souls, so please do not diminish the game calling it a copy of TBoI or ODP. There are a lot of brilliant and original ideas that made me like this game even more than TBoI, like secret stages, a lot of details and fluff, and obviously the plot itself. \\r\\nYou think that I\\'m bs you? Just buy it on sale, no bankruptcy for a couple of bucks!|;|If you like Isaac, you\\'re gonna like this game, I haven\\'t played much but I am already so excited to see what the future will bring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll those items  I haven\\'t collected yet! Boy, I can\\'t wait to find out what they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis basically Isaac but platformer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside is that the bosses (which I\\'ve seen so far) are kind of boring and easily figured out without much to them, but that\\'s only a small complaint!\\r\\n\\r\\nVery good game, love it so far!|;|This game is a hidden gem. It released late December in 2015, and so far as of the writing of this review, doesn\\'t seem to have gotten much attention. I only found out about it because I was digging through steam suggestions based on games similar to another Roguelike, and was suprised there was so little information about it anywhere considering how good it is. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt clearly gets inspiration from Binding of Isaac, but it\\'s a sidescroller. If you like Isaac you\\'ll probably like this too. Seriously, imagine Isaac as a sidescroller, and you have this. If that concept sounds interesting to you, like it did to me, then get this-you won\\'t be disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not just a Binding of Isaac clone though. This game takes an entirely different set of skills, and has it\\'s own kind of charm to it. It\\'s has a bit of a learning curve, especially if you\\'re used to the top down perspective. I found the game quite difficult, but once I got used to the controls and being in a 2D environment it felt a little more forgiving (Except those goddamn spikes). Thankfully the Author is very active and helpful, and constantly updates and works on improving the game, even going as far as writing a minguide to help people figure out certain aspects of the game. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, I\\'m very happy I purchased this game, and I hope it gets a lot more attention than it has so far. It really deserves it.|;|This game is fun, but it feels so unpolished. The last update was over a year ago and it seems like the dev no longer is working on it. It just feels incomplete. Because of that, I can\\'t recommend it despite how much fun it is.|;|TMoLE is not just an Isaac ripoff; it\\'s an Isaac ripoff that pits everyone against each other in super-competitive ladder mode, where people chase after #1 like it\\'s a Willy Wonka golden ticket and then sit on it, preening their feathers in the nucleus of the circle of attention for all to see.  I was in that circle of attention for about 2 weeks, and it was OMG-ly amazing, until some hardcore superfocused ADD-Rainman-savant came along and displaced me.  Now, just a handful of months later, the current high score is closing in on twice my high score as #1.\\r\\n\\r\\nGames that do not make you feel differently aren\\'t games.  TMoLE made me feel three separate emotions during different periods of my playing it:  good, bad, good about feeling good.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m okay with all of that.  I wish more games impacted me that much.|;|Okay when I first saw this little gem I watched the trailer video thing and the movement looked kinda weird and floaty but then a sale happend and I went ahead and got this game...THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY FUN and the controls are really tight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would defenitly pick it up if you like rogulikes.|;|First i want start off saying there isnt much wrong with this game technically, but little things keep adding up in my brain. This game is trying hard to be EXACTLY like The binding of Issac and in that....it fails. Ive fought several bosses that i instantly recgonized in their design and ability from Issac. From the bombs/coins/upgrade stats to the gameplay is all trying so hard to be like Issac and it really shows. Hell you\\'re chracter shoots orbs ot of her mouth in place of tears. I cant tell though if its trying to ripoff issac or trying to be like it but for me the comparisons are so obvious that its not an homage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow having said that, fans of Issac will find something to enjoy in this game. But the problem is if you likie Issac you might as well just play that instead of this game. The two are very similar in their desgin but one is just better at what it does. But it being cheap at $9 makes it hard to say \"Dont buy this game\" You\\'re not losing much if you dont enjoy and at most you will enjoy cause its familiar.|;|A solid roguelite platformer. If you want all or most of the achievements you will have to play a lot of runs and hope RNG is on your side. Some are very RNG reliant and you will only know if you have a chance at them half way or more through a run.|;|Emma is an incredible game. The comparisons to Isaac, Rogue Legacy, and Spelunky are certainly warranted, but that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing. As someone who has well over 500 hours in Isaac and a good amount of hours in Rogue Legacy, I can say with pretty heavy certainty that Emma does it\\'s comparisons justice. It keeps it fresh with new items and large amount of achievements so everything is always a little bit different. Having your level of \"madness\" dictate the difficulty of the game is an interesting touch, and the \"Everything in Terrible\"-esque (Isaac reference, yet again) change after beating False End for the first time is nice as well. After fourteen or so hours I have yet to be bored by the game, and every run is as different, exciting and challening as the last, if not moreso. I look forward to progressing even farther in the game as I traverse through dungeon after dungeon of both literal and figurative misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nTL;DR: This game is amazing, buy it if you like rogue-likes and platformers.|;|this game is amazing!! its a 2d side scrolling version of binding of isaac with better weapons. i never felt cheated by cheap kills like binding of isaac does.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis game is fun and challenging. its worth the $5 price point.|;|This game is similar to The Binding of Isaac thematically and mechanically. If you name a feature in Isaac and ask if it\\'s in Emma, the answer is probably yes. The main difference mechanically is that it\\'s an occasionally tense bullet hell platformer; the main difference thematically is that there\\'s no poop. Hopefully neither of those are dealbreakers for you, because everything that makes Isaac addictive--easily digested room-to-room pacing, unlockable characters and boss encounters, tons of stackable items--this game does just as well. Between the two, I think Emma is a little more twitchy and challenging; in Isaac you\\'re sometimes able to become a godlike being of destruction that clears boss fights instantly, and so far, at least, Emma is a little less forgiving. If you put any significant amount of time into Isaac or Spelunky you\\'ll be happy. I got it while it was on sale but the non-sale price point is still a good deal.|;|I reccomend it 100%, without giving too much about it away; the gameplay is exciting and challenging, the art and music are fantastic, there\\'s a wonderfully done eerie atmosphere, the controls are spot-on, and overall this is a really nice hidden gem on the Steam store. While its similarities to the Binding of Isaac are quite present you\\'ll be having so much fun playing the game that you won\\'t even notice.|;|I\\'ve got about 4 hours into the game and it\\'s just OKAY.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPros:  Great BoI adaptation.  If you like platforming and BoI, this is the game for you.  Plenty of new pickups and characters to unlock and challenging to boot.  Definitely a must if you\\'re one of those perfectionist gamers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:  Very unbalanced.  The characters I\\'ve unlocked have pretty cruddy starting stats and the game is SUPER control twichy.  It\\'s difficult to drop bombs in the game (I usually have to push the button 2 or 3 times and before you ask, it\\'s not a hardware problem).  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you like a great challenge, don\\'t mind spending a few bucks, and searching for the NVIDA patch (it\\'s in the forums, took me about 30 minutes to find it), pick this one up.  But if you\\'re one of those folks that get easily frustrated over mechanics and \"get gud\" scenarios, stay away.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBarely got a thumbs up from me.|;|I seem to be addicted to this game, despite my frustration for how it just drops me into bullet-hell. I find myself wanting more control over which power-ups I receive, and more opportunity for clever escape. Some rooms are dead-simple,  while others are pretty much impossible.. unless you have the right power-ups, of course. Frustrated but addicted is bad, so I cannot recommend the game.|;|The Madness of Little Emma is a good game, however it\\'ll take you a while to actualy start getting somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madness of Little Emma is a game inspired by Binding of Isaac, and takes a different approach on it by making it into a sidescrolling game (is sidescrolling the right word here? I\\'m not sure myself, so please let me know if it isn\\'t!)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nnow, as always, let\\'s start with the good stuff:\\r\\n\\r\\n+ the story, while it has a few similarities to BoI (which is prefer to call nod, because there\\'s only 2 noticeable one and they\\'re minor details), is very unique and intriguing, however, I cannot say anything about the ending as I have yet to reach them.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ the game is easy to grasp, you shoot at enemies with left click to kill them, and you place bombs with right click to break walls and other objects (or just blow up enemies), however, being able to effectively doge enemies and survive for more than 3 floors is where the game starts becomming difficult, so if you\\'ve never played a game like this before, you\\'ll suck for quite a while.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ the music isn\\'t anything special IMO, but it works really well with the grim tone the game has.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile this is all great, I have a few issues with this game:\\r\\n\\r\\n- such a game should have some sort of wiki, which it does not.\\r\\nHowever, the game is less than a month old and the community is pretty small, so I can understand it not having a wiki yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n- the game becomes repetitive really quickly, becasue of the small collection of items and the fact that there\\'s only one character, and for a game that can take a while to get good at, that is not a good thing\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, the game is fun, but I\\'d say that the game currently costs a bit too much for what it has as of right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal rating: 6/10|;|Imagine The Binding of Isaac....but it\\'s a platformer!!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a great idea, but unfortunately poorly executed. Sorry, I wanted this to succeed, but it just didn\\'t click for me.|;|got this on 0.90$ sale. pretty good but nothing too special. its alright, but its not that fun after you beat the normal game; i\\'ve only played arena after that. still good though|;|It looks like a fun platformer, but the controls make it nearly impossible to play.  It uses an FPS layout in the sense of WASD to move, and the mouse aims. This seems akward for this type of 2d game in my mind. The \"partrial controller support\" tag didn\\'t seem to be accurate in my case either. If you\\'re cool  with keyboard / mouse for this kind of game you might enjoy it though.|;|2D rogue like game , with score ladder .\\r\\ndiferent ending that are hard to get .\\r\\nreally cool game , give a try|;|this game is literally unplayable, i had to restart steam to boot another game because steam thought it was open but it wasn\\'t and it wasn\\'t in task manager ._. nice... i also remember it being bad when i bought it ages ago so probably just don\\'t buy this lol|;|This game has some of the worst controls I have seen in a 2D sidescroller.\\r\\n\\r\\n- controller mapping is broken and unintuitive, cant remap the controls\\r\\n- keyboard and mouse controls are kinda delayed, the shots dont fly where the cursor is, its slightly off....\\r\\n\\r\\nNot being able to control the character is a major problem and absolutely not worth buying, even for 2 bucks!\\r\\n|;|Binding of Isaac if Binding of Isaac was a platformer and not good|;|\\r\\nLike binding of isaac but extremely slow and tedious. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m still looking for a good isaac style platformer.|;|ok so how did no one mention there is no fullscreen? like really this the full release of the game with no fullscreen or decent controller support?!?! its not even good its just BOI but with bad controls i dont get why people are praising this game.|;|The Madness of Little Emma is one of those games that was compared to another (in this case, The Binding of Issac), and that caused me to skip it for a while. Luckily, I ended up picking this up on impulse during a sale, and I have found that I like it a lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there are some parallels to Issac, in that you have a character with a tragic backstory going a bit crazy, a plethora of characters to choose from, randomly generating maps, and loads of items you can collect. The thing that seperates it is that it becomes its own game as you play, with everything from the sidescrolling layout to the types of items keeping you wanting to play. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as layout goes, you have a map on the top of the screen that shows you where you are and all adjoining rooms. It also tracks your progress and it keeps a rudimentary tab on some items you miss. It will not, for example, tell you that you missed a treasure chest but it will inform you that you left coins or a heart behind. This helps a lot, too, and especially when you are hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have specific abiilities on the lefthand side that can be powered up in a few ways, with these basically controlling your strength, how fast you shoot, and your luck. Along with that, you have hearts that showcase your health, and that are removed in halves or wholesdepending on the enemy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to attacking, you have the left click shot and the right clickbomb. Different characters impact this differently; for example, you can unlock a little ghost girl that can shoot through walls. Still, this is basic - in a good way - meaning you do not have to worry about convoluted controls. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room layout has a few options, from the randomly spawned enemy rooms to rooms with games of chance, challenges, rooms to spend coins (or hearts sometimes), and bonus rooms. There is at least one bonus room per level, so you basically get an item for winning each time. There are also RIP rooms, wherein you pick up a large item as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as what you can find here, you have 100s of items that you can get and that can be stacked on top of one another, so you can become more and more powerful as you roam the game. For example, you may find a cloud that causes all your enemies to stick to it and a hat that gives you spikes if attacked from behind. You may find bugs to surround and protect you or an assault raven that hits baddies. You can also get shot upgrades, giving you bomb shots, stronger ones, stun ones, and on. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are loads of enemies in the game, too, giving you a variety of things to run into. From the basic moths that get in the way to the more complex enemies that shoot lightning or teleport, you have things to figure out and mater. The bosses also come in a variety of forms, from flying to those that spawn little helpers to snakes and the like. I like the boss fights because they are straight forward - there is a bar across the top depecting the boss health in read. Take it and you win. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also two modes of play. You can play the ladder, wherein you can see other people\\'s scores and compete by adding onto yours (this accumulates and does not go game by game), or you can play casual. \\r\\n\\r\\nI like this game quite a bit - it can be a good way to kill a few minutes or to set for an hour or two.|;|I have over 900+ hours on Binding of Isaac, and I can easily say it\\'s my favorite game. Madness of Little Emma does a fantastic job bringing back the love I have for Isaac since I started to play. The level of difficulty can be comparable, and the learning curve is the same. I hate to say it, but to me, it\\'s Binding of Isaac 2 with improvements. It\\'s a worthy pick up, and certainly worth the current price on Steam. I have, as I write this, about an hour, and can very plainly say, I found a new favorite game. If you like BOI, get this.|;|I love the graphics and story. I wasn\\'t expecting such a good short prologue that really got into the head of a girl losing her mind. It\\'s a hard game,but satisfying. I will say the movement of the character feels a little fast to me but that\\'s my only \\'complaint.\\'|;|i started playing this with trepidation. thinking i could not possibly enjoy how rough around the edges it seemed.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow i cant stop playing it. it scratches the itch of playing one more time to fulfil that hope of getting a proper build and finishing a playthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\njust right amount of frustration. very little resources for figuring things out. but thats ok.|;|This game has a lot to offer for a small price tag. It goes very cheap during steam sales and I was able to pick it up for $.8 and oh man is it worth that price!|;|I honestly got more out of this game then I expected to. Bought it on sale and it filled the itch that I needed to scratch for an easy to pick up but challenging to master roguelike. I think this game is very fun for the genre, you can tell the develeper put a large amount of time into balancing the game and all the different items in it. Well worth the money spent for the hours I played.|;|Imagine Binding of Isaac but a platformer, fun, and actually difficult.\\r\\nPlay it, it\\'s fun.|;|This game is a gem. At first I thought to expect a clone of The Binding of Isaac but it really excels in many ways and is a lot more fun to me. The art style is fitting, the music fits the mood of the game really well. The game can sometimes be extremely difficult to excel and sometimes easy. All depending on what toys you can find in each play through. Overall it\\'s a great game to play if you like action, strategy, and especially platformer games.\\r\\n\\r\\n8/10|;|I haven\\'t played much of this game, but I am already addicted.|;|Basically Binding of Isaac but platformer.

            "Original:  b'I love games like The Madness of Little Emma where you play a run at a time and try to get farther and farther, defeat difficult bosses, unlock powerful and fun items, and discover secret areas and challenges. This game fits that mold fairly well, but I can\\'t recommend picking up this game for a number of reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Unbalanced Items: The majority of items you will come across are pretty useless and sometimes (I\\'m not sure what determines this) picking up items increases your Madness stat by 1, a stat which makes the game harder. I\\'m not sure how exactly the difficulty increase works; I\\'m not sure if it scales with your Madness level or just increases the difficulty once you hit a certain threshold, but this mechanic encourages the player to pass up on most items due not only to their unhelpful effects, but due to the negative consequences of picking up a large number of items over time. That being said, there are a select few items that are really, really good. If you manage to find a combination of two or three items that work super well together, they can carry you for an entire run.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stats rely on RNG: This is a pretty common aspect of similar games, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work very well in The Madness of Little Emma. Your main source of stat boosts (which you won\\'t get very far without many of) are random Herbs scattered throughout the game. Sometimes they drop from enemies, sometimes you get them for clearing a challenge/arena room, sometimes you get them from treasure chests. Regardless of how you get them, there is a major flaw to this mechanic: the most common Herb type (green) has a chance to lower your stats. With how rare all Herbs are and with how quickly the difficulty of this game picks up, you need as many stat upgrades as you can possibly find, so not taking green Herbs isn\\'t a reliable option. You get one guaranteed purple Herb (increases a random stat) per boss fight, but sometimes that\\'s all you\\'ll get on the first floor, which to me is an instant restart. And it\\'s even worse when that stat upgrade happens to be Luck instead of Damage or Fire Rate. Some items will grant stats too, but, as mentioned above, a lot of items you\\'ll come across are simply not worth taking.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Run Ending Rooms: When you get farther in (floors 6+ usually), you can run into rooms that will completely ruin you if you don\\'t have an incredibly overpowered item loadout. Most normal enemies aren\\'t a problem, but get a room of the wrong champion enemies and there\\'s little you can do. The worst champion effects are explosive shots, slowing aura (which sometimes comes with another champion effect), and double damage shots, and these can be especially bad if you get a room with a lot of champion enemies, which honestly isn\\'t too uncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Unavoidable Damage: When you start playing this game you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run into a ton of this, but the farther you get in the game the higher the chance you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come across rooms where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much going on there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legitimately nothing you can do to maneuver out of the way of enemy attacks. Even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re completely overpowered (minus one combination of 2 items that actually completely breaks the game in your favor), run ending rooms are still likely to beat you up a little bit. The game tends to be pretty generous with dropping hearts for the player to pick up, but then you could enter another room where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re guaranteed to take damage and it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have really helped much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are my main gripes with this game, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough to make the game almost entirely unfun. Other than what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve listed, I have had the game crash on me once, but I did have it open for about 7 hours straight before that happened so that could easily have had something to do with it. In any case, there is definitely some fun to be had here, and I actually really love the Arena mode a whole lot, but the main game itself becomes incredibly painful to play. The difference between The Madness of Little Emma and many other roguelikes is that skill and knowledge of items/enemy patterns can only get you so far; you have to be incredibly lucky to have a shot at making real progress in this game. Because of this dependence on luck, you can try to get a good run started for hours and still not get anywhere, and then suddenly have two perfect items fall into your lap one after the other that will grant you a win.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interested in trying out this game, it has been pretty heavily discounted in the past and I would assume it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely to be on sale again at some point. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still on the fence about picking it up, with the Steam refund you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a two hour window of opportunity to try it out for yourself a bit and see if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up enjoying it more than I did, so I do encourage anyone interested to at least try the game before writing it off. Furthermore, there is a demo for this game available on Steam to try out without any worries of refunding. I would definitely recommend starting with the demo version.|;|The Madness of Little Emma is one of the few rogue-likes that caught my attention and didn\\'t let go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt certainly has lots of things in common with other rogue-like games, but it feels completely different. Mainly due to the fact that this is a platformer with rather satisfying movement physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game has a good learning curve: it doesnt tell you anything about its mechanics, you have to play, observe and note the changes. First couple of hours i had difficulty getting past 1st stage, 60 hours later the main reason for not reaching the 5th or 6th ending is that i made some mistake early on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely TMoLE has some rough edges, for example the cursor is somewhat bleak and sometimes i lose it in the background. But the developer is constantly working on the game, fixing bugs and adding new free content.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion: a great game for its price, challenging but rewarding.|;|This is a perfect example of everything an imitator game should be. It\\'s obviously \"The Binding of Isaac as a platformer\", but it successfully captures the mood, feel, fun and design philosophy of Isaac. The madness mechanics and the item pool do a good job capturing the feel of Isaac without feeling like a rehash. There\\'s great music, great enemy and boss design, varied items, and tons of secret levels. And oh yeah, it\\'s fun and really does feel like you\\'re playing a new version of Isaac.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: Game balance isn\\'t perfect for some items, characters, champion enemies and bosses. Neither is Isaac\\'s, but this game definitely occasionally has me going \"that room wasn\\'t fair\" while Isaac didn\\'t. Also, it\\'s hard to tell what some items do.|;|Take the theme and collectibles of Binding of Isaac, mix it with the 2d platformer aspect of Spelunky or Rogue Legacy; and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve pretty much got The Madness of Little Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some rooms and bosses can get downright bullet-hell-esque with the amount of fire they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re throwing at you, and even some fairly early enemies can be extremely vicious \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially ones that make quick leaps at you, potentally trapping you in a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe items you pick up tend towards passive bonuses, allowing for vicious stacking combos (if you get lucky, anyway \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plenty of dud items, although I have yet to find anything actively negative like accidentally picking up Soy Milk or Cursed Eye in Isaac.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music is good, and the pixel graphics work pretty well.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportantly, as of this writing (September 29th), the game is 80% off \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a mere $1.79. At that price, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great pickup for anyone who enjoys rogue-like/light/platformers/any of the games that I mentioned in my first sentence.|;|This is how it should be done. Instead of shoving your money up the arse of some early access scum buy this game. I bought in on release day, played through it, had a good time. But that was not it, the Dev Dude keeps updating it as frequently as I get disappointed by early access games. And that\\'s about once a week. I could see how the game improved with every patch, and now its better than ever before. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo that guy published a finished, perfectly fine game and now he even keeps updating it with new totally free content. Its sad that there only so few people who are playing it. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you love rogue like as much as I do, then this is a must buy. Give the Dev Dude you god damn money!|;|If I were grading on concept alone this is probably an \"A\" for me. That concept being that of a roguelight twin stick platformer featuring a seedy cartoon atmosphere and tons and tons of unlockables.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously heavily influenced by the Binding of Isaac everywhere from concept to theme to mechanics all the way down the line. No suprise to find it\\'s still a winning formula her even while I wish it was more original in some aspects it\\'s still a fun ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would say the underlying platforming/shooter mechanics are solid but not spectacular. To elaborate on that point a bit I just feel that the running around shooting etc. feels functional here as opposed to spectacularly fluid or satisfying.  Luckily the vast number of unlockables and different playstyles and upgrades makes the experience a plus 1 and the fact that I got this for just under 2 bucks makes me smile and shake my head at some of my other purchases.\\r\\n\\r\\n6/10|;|Really good music and I like the unique Binding of Isaac adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the movement alone is enough to deter me away from playing this game. It is beyond clunky. I really had high hopes because I love Binding of Isaac and this is similar, except in platformer format, but the movement need to be smoother for me to pick it up again.|;|UPDATE: Since the recent patches, I now no longer continue to have the problem when trying to open the game.  It will now open from Steam and the desktop, so that was fixed pretty quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, the game is influenced by other Rogue-like titles such as Isaac, but the one thing that this game doesn\\'t do is hold your hand.  A 2D rogue-like platformer that easily can stand as one of the tougher rogue-likes on the market.  From the couple of hours I\\'ve spent in the game, hardly do I even come CLOSE to seeing any 1 of the 4 endings mentioned.  Little Emma requires skill, simply put.  You\\'ll get damage ups, but the enemy placement and mini boss rooms range from \"easy to dodge\" to \"this room is the WORST\".  Some of the late game mobs, including these crying women who start bombarding you with explosions that are hard to track, are just a pain to deal with, if you even make it that far with no damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a bad game though?  Absolutely not because it\\'s still a very interesting rogue-like.  The story involves two children, Emma (oldest) and her little brother Timmy, who survive pretty much on their own.  One day, Emma wakes up to find Timmy missing as well as blood all over the room.  As she looks around, she notices a trap door (similar to Isaac\\'s adventure into the depths below) under a rug.  Assuming Timmy has been taken or wandered down there, she soon follows.  As far as story, it\\'s not strong.  I mean it holds a very similar take of the Isaac story that people have accustomed themselves to, but instead of a hateful mother, you\\'re the loving big sister.  Whether Timmy went down there on his own is still unknown.  Still having a hard time beating it once, I know nothing about the endings.\\r\\n\\r\\nControls are pretty standard and easy to understand at least for mouse and keyboard.  The room you spawn in shows you your controls.  A to move left, D to right, W to jump (as well as space), and D to go down platforms you can jump through.  You can also use the arrow keys for these commands as well.  You can also rebind keys if you have a more comfortable control scheme.  To use activation items, you press E.  Activation items, unlike space bar items in Isaac, require money to use instead of having to clear rooms.  It is here to prevent any of the items from seeming too overpowered, such as an item that freezes everything in the room or turns back time by a couple of actions.  You aim with your mouse, left click to shoot balls of spit and right click to drop bombs.  It\\'ll be best to have a mouse that you can change sensitivity on because there are moments where it\\'s hard to connect your hits.  While the keyboard controls are fine, the controller support is less desirable, even though it\\'s still supported.  Every time I\\'ve tried to play with the controller, I just put it back down because it feels weird.  You also don\\'t have as much freedom with aiming than you do with a mouse.  You also can\\'t rebind controller buttons, so right now whatever your buttons are mapped to, that\\'s what you\\'ll have to deal with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst offender of this release is the current technical issues.  Some issues, like what I\\'m having, is I can\\'t open the game from Steam or desktop.  I simply have to go into my steamapps, common, find Little Emma, and open up the \"Win\" batch file.  That then opens up a command window and does it\\'s thing before the game opens.  Slightly sloppy and a small hassle to play a game.  You also need Java installed for some reason.  These issues don\\'t prevent me from still enjoying the game, but I can understand why people buying and installing would be confused as to why their game doesn\\'t open.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, Emma is still an enjoyable experience if you\\'re looking for a rogue-like that is a little more tougher and requires more skill than RNG.  RNG still matters, of course, but it\\'s almost treated like it\\'s a second thought instead of a primary mechanic.  This game will not hold your hand, it will not pay you kindly with optimistic words of victory.  It will wreck you and frustrate you, but not because it\\'s unfair; because you require the skill to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead.  If the previous negative remarks about this game get fixed, it\\'ll only continue to show how valuable this game is to the rogue-like genre.|;|Yes, this game is very, VERY derivative of several games, to the point where the intro made me think \"Is this Binding of Isaac told from Mom\\'s perspective?\" at first. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut you know, theme and general feel aside...Derivative or not, sometimes you have to respect solid craftsmanship. This is VERY nicely done. Definately worth a look.|;|TL;DR - Despite some of its flaws, low budget, and how heavy-handedly it draws from its obvious inspirations, Emma is a competently made game with enough fun and unique ideas to make it a worthy addition to the rogue-like-like genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs someone with over 1000 hours in the Binding of Isaac games, I\\'ve been curious to try the Madness of Little Emma for awhile now, since Isaac appears to be its most obvious influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m writing this review of my initial impressions of the game after only having played a few runs, with my latest being a fairly decent one (I made it to \"Misery\" and managed to clear some sort of Love-themed optional dungeon).  I\\'m not sure how close to the end I made it, but I feel I experienced enough of the game to give me a good idea of what kind of experiences I can expect  from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the game draws heavily from its Isaac inspiration, the most obvious difference is its side-on perspective and the inclusion of some basic platforming elements.  If Isaac is a variation on Zelda-type dungeon crawling, Emma is a variation on Metroid.  The movement feels good - due to the game\\'s focus on bullet-hell type enemies (more so than Isaac even), the ability to jump, dodge, and weave between enemy bullets is crucial, and game controls quite well in that regard.  While I normally prefer to play platformers with a controller (and the game does kind of support it, but not very well), mouse and keyboard seems to make the most sense for this game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art style is quite dark, and lacks the silly gross-out humor found in the Binding of Isaac.  Most of the early enemies are just some gnarly insects, but some of the later enemies are downright Lovecraftian masses of eyeballs, slime and sinew.  Though there is some humor in the game, most of it seems pretty straight-faced and grim, and the music, which is mostly subdued and atmospheric, adds to that aesthetic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spirit of the gameplay is very much like Isaac.  Players play as Emma or one of several unlockable characters and traverse procedurally-generated dungeon maps.  Maps are randomly populated with a series of rooms - upon entering a room, the doors lock behind you until all the enemies have been cleared.  Also like in Isaac, death is permanent, and each run starts you over from scratch aside from any unlockables you managed to get from your previous run.  The enemies themselves seem quite varied in both appearance and attack abilities.  Some fire bullets in a wide range of patterns and effects, some chase you down in varying ways (through walls, divebombing from the sky, teleporting across the room, etc), some spawn other enemies, some fire beams, and some are, frankly, just hard to describe - I\\'m actually tempted to say there might even be more individual enemy variety in this game than in Isaac.  In addition to enemies, some rooms have chests of varying quality (brown, gray, gold, and red in rare cases) some of which require a bomb to open.  The are also spike traps, and bombable walls, secret rooms, and occasionally colored herbs which grant the player stat buffs (or debuffs) when consumed, sort of like pills in Isaac.  Each floor contains one treasure room which randomly draws from a large pool of stat/ability altering items (over 250), one boss room, and sometimes one or more \"special rooms\" like a sacrifice room (sacrificing health/consumables for herbs [maybe items?]), Arenas (fighting off waves of enemies for loot), Shops (which contain herbs, chests, and a creepy hooded skeleton man who doesn\\'t understand the meaning of \"personal space\"), and what I call \"Hanging Rooms\" which feature a girl hanging by a noose who drops an item when you shoot her.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOf the items I\\'ve found so far, some seem familiar, and some unique.  In my last run I found an item which caused friendly ghosts to spawn around me and chase down enemies (like blue flies in Isaac), a helpful robot friend that orbited my body and shot down enemy projectiles with a laser, an item which made my \"tears\" larger and stronger when I stood still, and an item that made me fart enemy-stunning perfume.  It\\'s not yet clear to me whether or not Emma features the same level of item synergy found in Isaac, though I would assume it does to some degree or another.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat is only superficially similar to that in Isaac.  While Emma also fires white tear-like projectiles (or maybe it\\'s spit?), the high movement speed, ability to jump, and the 360 degree aiming makes for a much faster and potentially more hectic experience than in Isaac.  After the first few floors, the bullet hell aspects of this game seriously ramp up - whereas Isaac is more focused on predicting enemy shots and carefully placing yourself between them, Emma seems to require more twitch reflexes and simply running the fuck away from situations when they get too hairy.  The later levels can become seriously overwhelming in that regard, so much so that I find it difficult to imagine that player should be expected to be able to dodge all of the shots instead of simply taking it on the chin and using your (generous) invincibility frames to better position yourself around some cover.  On the one hand, this seems somewhat reasonable despite the game being fairly withholding when it comes to health and especially health upgrades, on the other, one of the things I love so much about Isaac is the predictability of enemy attacks and being able to avoid damage simply by being smart.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBosses are also a big part of the game, and so far I\\'ve only found a couple that remind of those from Isaac.  One was a segmented snake monster that bounced around the room, the other was a big face that split into multiple smaller faces when enough damage had been dealt to it.  So far, other than those two, I haven\\'t seen any others which immediately reminded me of Isaac bosses.  That said, I can\\'t say I found most of the bosses I fought to be particularly fun or compelling.  One was a giant fly that lazily glided around the room occasionally popping out two smaller flies that would each fire a single projectile (and small flies dropped hearts, which seemed unnecessary given how easy the fight was).  In the optional Love-themed dungeon I stumbled across, the boss was a large heart that bounced around the room spewing out bullets in an octagonal pattern, which would split into more large bullet-spewing hearts as it got damaged, repeating this process until 8 or so of these large hearts had been defeated.  Of the bosses I encountered, my favorite was called Entozoon, who looked like a giant demented Pez dispenser and flew off-and-on the screen spewing bullets and carpet-bombing the room, requiring some interesting dodging to avoid being hit.  While admittedly I haven\\'t even seen half of the bosses in the game yet, I\\'m a little disappointed in the boss rooms, which so far have been empty rectangular rooms that don\\'t seem to take advantage of one of the game\\'s main mechanics - the platforming.  You\\'re mostly just running back and forth across the floor dodging projectiles and hopping over the bosses when they get too close.  There\\'s no verticality to fights from what I\\'ve seen (though, again, it\\'s possible I just didn\\'t get to see those fights).  On the later levels the game somewhat manages to remedy this by spawning bosses in the normal rooms which makes more a much interesting fight.  I just wish platforming had been more of a consideration for those early boss fights to keep them from feeling so dull.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, aside from my complaint about boss fights, and a few bugs I noticed during the screen transitions, I quite enjoyed my time with this game.  Emma manages to wear its inspiration on its sleeve without being overshadowed by it and has its own unique brand of fun charm.  Fans of the Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, or even Terraria will probably find more than a little to love here.|;|I don\\'t have much to add that others haven\\'t already said.  It\\'s got a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac, but as other reviewers have noted, it doesn\\'t feel like a rehash.  There are a handful of new and interesting ideas in the game, and there\\'s more than enough content to entertain you for a dozen or more hours - much more if you want to see what the unlocks are, find new power ups, and see the various endings.  There are unfair moments that will frustrate you, and the rare bug (in 150 or so times i\\'ve done a playthrough so far, i\\'ve had 3 games where a bug prevented me from continuing), but overall the game feels pretty good - even if maybe it\\'s a bit unbalanced at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s disappointing that more people haven\\'t snagged this game - i think it\\'s much better than the numbers are indicating (only 94 reviews as of this post).  Maybe some folks are turned off by the $8.99 price - i think i got it on sale for just a couple dollars myself.  But my opinion on that might be a special case, since i don\\'t buy any games over 10 bucks as a rule (after all, i have about a hundred games i haven\\'t even installed yet - anytime i think i want a game more than $10, i remind myself of that fact!)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy strongest endorsement of the game is simply my number of hours in game - 64 at this point, and still going.  That being said, i don\\'t feel like the replay value is anywhere near Binding of Isaac - but maybe that doesn\\'t really say much, since i have about a thousand hours in that game across the original + rebirth + afterbirth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you like difficult platformers that have tons of things to unlock and discover, then this is certainly worth a try.  If you do decide to buy this, try to give it a couple of hours before your verdict - my own opinion of the game has only improved with more playthroughs...|;|An amazing game, all it\\'s own once you get past it\\'s similarities with other games.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve played this a fair bit, and stream it often, and intend to carry on doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it\\'s obvious that it\\'s heavily influenced by other games, such as The Binding Of Isaac, the creater has clearly defined this as a seperate game, adding other mechanics not see in similar games, differentiating it from the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy it immensely, the game having huge replayability, and a ton of unlockables (with more to come, hopefully).\\r\\n\\r\\nChallenging and fun, people really need to give this more than a few minutes playing and complaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan\\'t wait for more updates.|;|Basically, Binding of Isaac as a platformer - downright to the dark setting, artwork and general gameplay. If you liked binding of isaac and like platformers, you\\'re going to enjoy this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that can be bothersome are the controls. I\\'ve never been a fan of platformers with mouse aim, so if you are bothered by it, you better maybe playing something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the game is a little rough on the edges: the trasition between the screens sometimes can cause a shaky effect on the screen because the camera goes up and down really fast a couple times before settling in the new character position. Also, the game over screen could be a little more flashed out, instructing the player to press any key to go to the main screen (I found myself waiting for visual feedback every time I died lol)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut nonetheless, is a fun game. Like I said in the beginning, if you like BoI and platformers, you\\'re going to like this game for sure.|;|This game really wants to be The Binding of Isaac.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a good amount of effort put into making it and I did find myself wanting to keep playing at times, but it really lacks polish. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter movement feels a bit too fast for precision but too slow to navigate some of the more obnoxiously designed rooms with way too many walls that form labyrinthian paths to the next room.\\r\\n \\r\\nCharacter progression feels slow and unrewarding, and you\\'ll feel underpowered in most runs. There\\'s a pretty large pool of items but so many of them have underwhelming effects so the few items that the game gives you in an average run barely give you any power. Too many similar status effect modifiers and worthless active items, and not enough damage. The game is so stingy that you\\'ll be lucky if you find a damage up after two floors. It doesn\\'t help that a lot of enemies are really spongy. There\\'s even a few items that are so bad that they can end a run on their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant number of chests spawn on top of large rows of spikes and low ceilings so you\\'re pretty much guaranteed to lose life trying to get the items inside.  There\\'s also chests that are only reachable by bomb jumping. The game does not drop enough hearts to compensate for the forced damage chests. It\\'s usually not even worth it to try since chests barely give anything good. A lot of them only give 1 coin or 1 half-heart.\\r\\nConsumables don\\'t drop enough in general. You only get enough coins in a typical run to maybe buy two items from shops, and that\\'s only if you avoid using active items altogether, which have coin costs that can go up to 4 coins per single use. There\\'s an optional secret area that only spawns if you\\'re holding 50 coins and you\\'ll most likely never see it unless you play the character that starts with 30 coins and still avoid buying items.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome enemies and projectiles are hard to see in some of the later areas. Red orbs on a dark orange background or pale homing skulls on a light brown background, and the same skulls also look exactly the same as some projectiles that are created by player items so you don\\'t even know which are good and which are bad sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nArena challenge rooms can spawn enemies a few pixels away from you so you have no time to react, or even directly on your character if you\\'re playing the flying character. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe flying character gets stuck on slopes instead of moving along them. \\r\\n\\r\\nMultisegmented bosses can have a trawl effect on each segment that instantly wipes out your entire inventory of consumables. Regular enemies can have that modifier, too, so you tend to lose your bombs and coins a lot but at least you have a chance to save a coin or two in regular rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mouse isn\\'t locked to the game window in Windowed Mode. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can\\'t rebind the bomb key for some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nA room in an early area that can spawn a dozen high HP mobs in a small space that fly through walls closing in on you, is almost guaranteed death on most characters. There\\'s bullet hell rooms that are near impossible to survive in, made worse by your imprecise movement. Mini bosses with modifiers that can immobilize you in said Bullet Hell rooms. There\\'s a bunch of rooms in general that feel like trollish traps that are almost guaranteed to end a run. You can\\'t skip them, and it wouldn\\'t matter anyway because you don\\'t know which rooms are death traps until you enter them. 90% of the rooms in this game are brain dead easy and a dozen or so that are so ridiculous that you\\'ll lose 5 full hearts just trying to get a couple hits in.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnemy bullets have infinite range but your character\\'s shot range is very short. Sometimes it\\'s impossible to even get near an enemy because there\\'s 3 or 4 enemies near the ceiling that never stop shooting an absurd amount of projectiles, and you\\'re just stuck in a corner inching back and forth to dodge the unending barrage of projectiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a lot more fun in the separate Arena mode than the main mode since it\\'s a lot more generous with its items and buffs, not to mention you get a choice of multiple items instead of getting stuck with whatever garbage RNG throws at you in the main mode. There\\'s item synergies and special item interactions in this game but you\\'d never know if you only played the main mode. Finding all four Monster familiars combines them into a single, larger familiar, \\xc3\\xa0 la Isaac\\'s Super Bum, that shoots large piercing lasers, for example. It feels like a lot of secrets are tied to RNG.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of these complaints were minor nitpicks but there\\'s definitely a lot of unfair or unpolished design that sours the entire experience. A lot of my deaths felt like they weren\\'t my fault, and most runs aren\\'t very fun because the game refuses to give you any damage buffs. The game could be really good with some more development time and proper balancing but I can\\'t recommend it in its current state. It seems development has ended, though.|;|Really fun and well made. I love the art style, the sound effects, the items and characters (my favourite is Elizabeth, because she\\'s OP). I wholeheartedly recommend this to any rogue-like fans!|;|I was quite happy to see this gem made it to steam and bought it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a rather obvious hommage of The Binding of Isaac and it\\'s influences. You\\'ll recognize a lot of things quickly, if you are familiar with BoI. There is, however, a crucial difference: The Madness of little Emma is a platformer, which adds a refreshing spin to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are already plenty of items in this game and it is possible to see what they do by pressing Esc and going into the items menu, which removes a bit of the guessing game and makes it easier to learn the ropes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the enemies are concerened, most patterns are easy to learn, though, not surprisingly, there are some that need some getting used to, as well as those that very likely need some tweaking. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s also an insanity meter in this game. The higher it goes, the faster enemies become and the earlier more difficult ones/variants spawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally, I only experienced a glitch and one crash/freeze, but I\\'m fairly confident that those will be fixed/tracked down quickly, since a look at the discussions shows that the dev is communicating closely with the community to get rid of those problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis game also comes with a very good soundtrack as far as I am concerened, so all in all I heartily recommend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally: This is my first review, so i hope I managed to touch upon the important points.|;|A great game! Kind of short, but it\\'s just the right amount of time for a busy, working-class guy, like myself. I\\'m very happy with this purchse. I know everyone has said a lot of good things about this game so I\\'d like to point out something different:\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that really annoys me about platforming games, rouge-like ones in particular, is when the dev doesn\\'t take the time to get the running/jumping/platforming mechanic solid. This game achieves that very well. You move around the screen at a good pace, not too fast not too slow. You won\\'t find yourself running into damage because your character failed to react to your movements. Also you don\\'t continue to slide around after running/jumping. I rarely found myself getting frustrated at not being able to reach a ledge and at no time was it due to my character just continuing to move and fall off due to bad mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\nBig kudos on nailing the basics of gameplay! A lot of devs tend to overlook that.|;|Edit: Changed some of the wording and updated it a little bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madness Of Little Emma is a nice little action platformer. If you\\'re a fan of The Binding Of Isaac (TBOI) it should kind of feel familiar as it is heavily inspired by it at times. Normally, I don\\'t write reviews, but this game has so few players that I feel I have to.\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]What is The Madness Of Little Emma?[/u]\\r\\nThe Madness Of Little Emma is an 2D action platformer set in a dark world. As in TBOI you have one \"item room\" on every floor, there are sacrifice rooms - though they\\'re not working like the ones in TBOI - shops, dare rooms, secrets and some more. You also have to beat a boss at the end of the floor to go down deeper and deeper until you reach the final boss.\\r\\nBut most things still are working quite different than in TBOI. So TMOLE isn\\'t just an \"TBOI as an action platformer\", but is its own game and has its own appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]What could be better:[/u]\\r\\n- [b]Items[/b]\\r\\nSome items are really good and fun to play with, but most of the items don\\'t really help you or worse make your run worse. While TBOI also had the same kind of items, I feel that they had more use.\\r\\nAfter having played some more I don\\'t think the items are that big of a problem anymore. I probably expected too much of them, but unlike in TBOI in this game most items won\\'t make your run. TMOLE relies more on the skill of the player than having great items which doesn\\'t mean that good items can\\'t save your run.\\r\\nExample for \"bad\" items: I was really disappointed in the shuriken, it looked really nice in the trailer, but when I obtained it, it just felt bad. Having to fight enemies with a shield is pure horror, as you can hit them twice mostly or even just once and you have to wait for the shuriken to return to you before you can throw it again, while their shield is back up.\\r\\nExample for \"good\" items: The raven. I just love that little ugly bird. He can fly through walls and instantly attacks the first enemy in sight while you can still shoot and he does quite some damage. Always nice to have and it makes the run much easier.\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]Neutral:[/u]\\r\\n- [b]It\\'s hard[/b]\\r\\nLike really really hard. Maybe even harder than TBOI. But that\\'s ok, I like challenging games. After having said that, you can still beat the \"endboss\" on your first day playing. The good thing is, that this game doesn\\'t end there. It more or less just begins.\\r\\nI also like the fact that you can control the hardness by collecting madness from items or the hanged girl. The more madness you have, the harder the game gets. Like TBOI elite enemies also get a lot more common, if you beat the \"endboss\" the first time.\\r\\nBut there are things right now that I feel are to difficult. Of course it could be my limited skill, but I find most of  the elite bosses to hard. For example elite Liquid Sisters are taking up 2/3 of the bossroom and the bubbles they shoot, which explode into more shots, are taking the rest of the room. Some bosses are easier than others and you have to get used to most of them and even then it\\'s still a challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[u]What\\'s good:[/u]\\r\\n- [b]Leaderboard[/b]\\r\\nYou gain points by how well you played and by how far you could go in your playthrough. Note that every playthrough counts as long as you play the ladder mode. The Ladder gets reset every two weeks (at the time I\\'m writing this review).\\r\\n[i]Edit: It seems like the ladder wasn\\'t resetted since i wrote this review the first time.[/i]\\r\\n- [b]RNG/ randomly generated dungeons including which items, rooms, shops etc you get[/b]\\r\\nEvery new run just feels kind of unique and refreshing. You always want to find out, which item you get on the floor. But even though I love that there are 250 items in the game - some of which you have to unlock -, if you haven\\'t unlocked enough it feels like you get the same items again and again. Maybe it\\'s just me, but I get baseball glove like 50% of my runs.\\r\\n- [b]No tutorial-ing[/b]\\r\\nYou get to know the basics of the game and thats it. Not even the specialties of the characters you can unlock are explained, so you have to find everything out yourself (or use the wiki). It feels like starting TBOI all over again and I love it.\\r\\nIf you want to get into this game, I suggest you check out the official beginner guide by the creater, Hugeowl. You can find it in the steam guides, it explains the basics and helps a lot for the start.\\r\\n- [b]Active Items[/b]\\r\\nI just like how they work. Most of the time you have to pay some small amount to use the item. In TBOI it would probably suck, but here it works really well.\\r\\n- [b]Unlocks[/b]\\r\\nLike TBOI there are different endings, items, bosses etc to unlock. I love unlocking things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all TMOLE is a fun indie game and it still gets patches from time to time, so it has the potential to get better and better. It may not be a flawless game and sometimes even a little bit too hard, but if you have fun with TBOI you pretty sure will have fun with TMOLE. Also, supporting an indie developer feels nice.|;|The Madness of Little Emma. Even though it was heavily influenced by The Binding of Isaac, gameplay is very different. Well, it\\'s obvious because Emma is a platformer game.\\r\\nAlthough the game is a bit unpolished at this moment, it\\'s still very enjoyable. The most noticeable thing is that there\\'s no much variation in room layouts. Of course they\\'re different from level to level, but you can see the same layout on the same level pretty often. But oh well, it\\'s just a matter of time.\\r\\nOf course, it\\'s really hard and you may need a bit of a time to get used to it. Especially it\\'s important to get used to spikes - they\\'re a major game element.\\r\\nThe music is pretty nice. Episode 3\\'s theme is probably my favorite.|;|Although I enjoy this game, I don\\'t feel like it offers much more than many of the other rogue-lights I\\'ve played. I feel like its good, but I don\\'t feel like its for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, that doesn\\'t mean its not for you. It\\'s definitely fast paced, has an enjoyable environment and atmosphere, and requires some point awareness at times. \\r\\n\\r\\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. Not for me, but I wouldn\\'t tell you not to try it.|;|Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, calling The Madness of Little Emma a clone of The Binding of Isaac would be giving it too little credit. It very obviously draws heavy influence, using a very similar HUD, (almost) identical means of attacking and even all but reusing some of the enemies and bosses from TBOI, including directly borrowing names (I\\'m looking at you, Haunt). Despite the striking resemblance to Isaac, the platformer aspect helps to keep the gameplay fresh. [i]It helps to think of The Madness of Little Emma as what it is, a standalone game, and not as an Isaac clone.[/i] The side view as opposed to a top-down view offers possibilities for interesting items and enemies, such as giving your shots weight allowing you to shoot in arcs, and the Twin Sisters boss which drops from the ceiling above you. Jumping around to dodge enemies and shots is difficult and a little frustrating at first, but I enjoy it more and more as I play. The knife-throwing enemies on the third floor are surprisingly fun to fight in narrow hallways with ceilings just low enough to evade damage with a well-timed jump.\\r\\n\\r\\nAesthetically, The Madness of Little Emma really shines. The Binding of Isaac has some of my favorite concepts for bosses (The Cage, The Lamb), and even though I\\'ve only seen early-game bosses and enemies as of the writing of this review, Emma does a fantastic job of being more creepy and less cartoony. The mass of eyeballs that can be found on the third floor that make that wonderfully creepy sound when they split and the first chapter boss \\'The Haunt\\' that floats around menacingly with that horrific smile (think that weird distorted smiledog.jpg picture) are two of my favorite examples. The dark color palette looks great and I love what little I\\'ve heard of the soundtrack thus far. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, The Madness of Little Emma is a fun little game that I\\'m definitely glad I bought. I won\\'t say that it\\'s better or worse than Isaac, I\\'ll just say it\\'s a fun standalone rogue-like that I would definitely recommend.|;|I was on the fence for positive/negative on this one... I\\'m going thumbs down.  <aside>Why don\\'t we get a scale 1-5 or something, Steam?  C\\'mon!</aside>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s like the creator wanted to make Binding of Isaac, but that was already done:\\r\\n* Play in a series of increasingly deep basement rooms and floors? Check.\\r\\n* Lots of random power-ups that can have synergistic effects? Check.\\r\\n* Big Boss to fight at the end of the floor? Check.\\r\\n* Body fluids as weapons? Check.\\r\\n* Treasure chests, coins, and bombs? Check.\\r\\n* Shops with undead shopkeepers? Check.\\r\\n* Sad and creepy back story and enviroment? Check.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be fair, the creator has said s/he was inspired by TBOI, but I just don\\'t find this game as fun.  Some things I don\\'t like:\\r\\n* Your main weapon is <i>spit</i>.  Yes, you happily spit at your enemies, not the sad tears of TBOI.  To me this is just weird.\\r\\n* Your shot range is about 1/4 the screen width, but enemy shots fly across the entire room.  This cannot be improved (at least that I\\'ve seen so far except by one or two powerups).  You can get hit by an enemy that died eight seconds ago.\\r\\n* Edit 2/26 addition: A consequence of the previous point: if the shot doesn\\'t move very quickly (happens with some enemy types) or at all, the shot will stay on the screen for a VERY long time.  Beyond all reason.  Waiting for you to touch it.\\r\\n* TBOI is played as a top-down view of rooms.  TMOLE is played as a side view of rooms with platforms.  Jump, jump, jump.  I don\\'t find this fun, maybe you will.\\r\\n* F*cking spikes everywhere.  You can prevent damage if you jump up from them quickly.... once.  After that they are extended, good luck getting past them.  Half the treasures are spike puzzles, or you just can\\'t get them unless you want to die for them.\\r\\n* To compensate for all the spikes, there is a ghost character (Elizabeth) that can fly and shoot through (some) barriers and is not affected by spikes.  This character has some limitations such as increased damage received, but I can\\'t seem to enjoy playing with any other character.\\r\\n* Edit add 2/26: Elizabeth can shoot \"ghost\" spit through most barriers, unlike the non-dead chars.  She can also fly.  This compensates for the platform craziness required of other chars, but some of the items you pick up nullify her advantages.  E.g., bouncy spit prevents her normal ability to spit through barriers the enemies can\\'t.  Many other items are useless (e.g, she can already fly so catching that item doesn\\'t help.)  Hope you have that item catalog handy!\\r\\n* Most rooms are too dim to easily see the walls.  You can get stuck because you can\\'t see the dim wall stopping you while you are trying to get away from enemies.  Did you die unexpectedly?  Oh, that slightly less black wall in the already noisy background was there.\\r\\n* Items are just random and weird and often not helpful.  If you don\\'t remember what the item does, too bad (e.g., the one that drops your fire rate really low).  There is a catalog, but finding the item in the list before you touch it is not easy.  Once you pick it up it becomes part of a separate list (but too late if it\\'s bad).\\r\\n* Edit add 2/26: The game seems to confuse \"hard\" with \"impossible\".  A hard game would require more skill to succeed in, but some rooms are just absolutely impossible.  Bullet hell with bullets all moving at different speeds, and your char speed is way too fast to reasonably maneuver in the tiny intervals between them.  Or enemies with insane advantages (I\\'m looking at you, brown liquid sisters.)\\r\\n* The occasional, infuriating, unexpected crash to desktop.  I was having a good game, too!!\\r\\n* The painful rare but not-impossible punishment of having your luck dropped to zero.  Majorly reduced chance of bombs, coins, and hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some interesting creativity to differentiate it:\\r\\n* Arena rooms give a reward after surviving a fight.\\r\\n* Edit add 2/26: Arena mode is a way to learn about many items that otherwise you only occasionally encounter.\\r\\n* Sacrifice rooms give a reward for giving up health, bombs, and coins.\\r\\n* Special and secret levels: beehive, dark tunnel, space, others.\\r\\n* Creative enemy types, even if most have analogues in TBOI.\\r\\n* Unique and consistent, distinct art style\\r\\n* Good music\\r\\n\\r\\nBuy it if TBOI is not enough for you.  But get that one first.|;|Let me start out by saying I\\'ve had lots of fun playing this game and I still am! This game has so many items and hidden rooms I\\'m still unlocking them and trying to figure out how everything works. I can say hands down I would recommend this game to just about anyone, it\\'s not a serious hard core game but it\\'s cute and unique in it\\'s own creepy way. Even though I\\'ve been played the game for a while now it\\'s not that repetitive at all, each dungeon is completely unique offering different items, bosses, and secrets making each run Really fun or just fustraiting. 10/10 Great buy|;|Fun roguelite game to sink some hours in, is a challenge, but fun to master. I have yet to even see all the items yet and I look forward to finding more combinations!|;|I\\'ve played almost 50 hours of this game, so I guess I\\'m qualified to review it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s pretty great. 8.5/10 you should buy it. The only thing I have against it is its difficulty- despite played it for 50 hours, I\\'ve only unlocked the first ending. You\\'d think I\\'d reach the others by now, but nope. What\\'s particularly cruel to me is the ladder mechanic; dying early in the game can make my ladder score go down by thousands of points, which is a serious rage quiter :( it discourages experimentation and induces rage. The game does have a \"casual mode\" that allows you to play without touching the ladder score, but that takes out the fun of trying to raise it and doesn\\'t really reward experiementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall though, the atmosphere, story, randomization is really good. I give 8.5/10.|;|I greatly recommend The Madness of Little Emma for anyone who likes rogue-lites and challenging games with tons of replayability.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like this game.\\r\\nAlthough heavily inspired, it manages to be unique and inventive. After playing a lot of Rebirth and getting a bit bored with it, I found The Madness of Little Emma to soothe the craving while not being just more of the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely worth the price, too. There is a surprising amount of content and a great deal of replay value. It always feels exciting to figure out what an item does, to finally kill a boss or to find yet another secret. Also, I love the music.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if I like the game visually but that\\'s not what I\\'m here for. There are so many good things about this game that it would be silly to judge it just by it\\'s looks, which aren\\'t too bad anyways.|;|so I played this game a few hours and I must say that its definitely worth the money.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Addictive ... because you want to go further and find new items see new enemys etc\\r\\n- Good music\\r\\n- Nice design\\r\\n- Leaderboard ( I am currently place 25 )\\r\\n\\r\\nonly thing I dont like are the spiky things on the ground sometimes its a bit unfair to reach some treasure chests ^^\\r\\n\\r\\nbuy it ! :)|;|Imagine Binding of Isaac except as a platformer and you pretty much have this game. Unfortunately some aspects of a game  don\\'t work nearly as well in platformer form as it does Legend of Zelda style and it clearly shows in this game. There\\'s some original ideas. It\\'s more horrorcentric and if you want a roguelike that is a bit more dependent on skill rather than memorization, this will fit the bill, but expect a much greater difficulty than in Isaac.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately that difficulty increase doesn\\'t feel intentional. Spikes that seem to be meant to push up if you stand on them too long, damaging you, seem to switch to the \\'stab\\' state too quickly to really utilize this as a mechanic and you can easily get treasure screwed early on because of their placement. Similarly, many of the items you can get are useless or actively detrimental to your gameplay. Once I got flight and was like \\'woo flight\\'--in Binding of Isaac this was one of the best items you could get but in this one it\\'s actually awful and many of the traits you can get are like this. \\'Great in Isaac, awful in a platformer\\'. While there were subpar items in Isaac, you could often make use of all of them in certain situations but some of the items in this game are legitimately just pointless to have around or only really detrimental to your play (like the flight option that has such a slow leadup time you\\'re likely going to get hit). If you didnt\\' have to hold down spacebar to stay afloat it might have been a much more useful item.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeating the first chapter wasn\\'t that hard but once I got to story 2 I couldn\\'t progress much further as a cheap enemy comp would generally destroy me. \\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly the pacing is a lot slower. You can\\'t just rush a backtrack like you can in Isaac. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn short the difficulty spike is too much and frankly the difficulty spike rarely seemed fair. The bosses seem to be well designed but the rooms themselves hardly and the story from what I\\'ve seen--hardly original or curious.|;|Wow I\\'m unexpectedly impressed. This game is actually really good!\\r\\nPros:\\r\\n+Like Binding of Isaac, the powerups you get are very relevant and gamechanging (unlike EtG imo)\\r\\n+The art looks really good. Little critters fill the rooms and bring them to life\\r\\n+The music is also really good. Very reminiscent of BoI also.\\r\\n+There are secrets galore. The wiki is really lacking at the moment, so a lot of things about the game feel like a mystery. This is a plus to some and a con to other, but I find it kind of refreshing that the game feels so unexplored and new right now. This is one of my favorite things about the game.\\r\\n+You can click on the menu to find out what items do. You dont need to look up items in your inventory\\'s effects on a wiki.\\r\\n+The seplechur miniboss is super interesting\\r\\n\\r\\nCons (These cons are all very very small nitpicky things, the pros are a way bigger deal):\\r\\n-Jumping feels a little too floaty to me. Becomes a non-issue once you get used to it.\\r\\n-One of the bosses so far (I think it was the haunt) can get into situations where its impossible to dodge their attack. This is very likely the players fault though. He\\'s too tall to jump over, so if he charges you and you aren\\'t positioned right so that he charges horizontally, then you cant dodge. \\r\\n-Spikes come up a little too fast imo. I am disincentivised to ever try grabbing chests on them because I always take damage.|;|Cute little rogue-lite. Cool concepts, but gameplay is slippery and too repetitive.|;|Nice game with good procedural generation. Lots of endings. Unfortunately, it\\'s very difficult to get every of them.|;|The game is such a cool. In it have a lot of mystery and for this I like it so much. The soundtrack is great. In it have and a lot of items which is ather cool think in the game.|;|At first I had a negative impression of this game due to the lack of controller configuration options, but was contacted bya developer who told me how to manually change the controller mapping through the steam files and now I can play the game just fine, actually a very fun game.|;|I changed my mind; Short version:\\r\\nA game that combines elements of shooters like Turrican and The Bonding of Issac into a promising experience that needs some work\\r\\nThe game is still improving, and the developer is quick to respond to complaints with kindness, even my former scathing review\\r\\nLoads of content, neat ideas under the hood, but...\\r\\nNeeds patience to work with, and requires manually editing a config file to adjust control pad controls, which isn\\'t great, but since I tweak my Fallout/Elder Scrolls ini files, I can\\'t really complain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, it\\'s a neat little game that I hope the developer continues to improve, because it\\'s got lots of potential.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong Version:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I recently wrote a review for The Madness of Emma wherein I went a bit away from my usual review style and into griping about one thing that bugged me and letting it ruin my experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s... not who I want to be, although it apparently IS who I am, so let\\'s see if, in honor of New Years and the swift response from the developer, I can\\'t give a better review. To be clear, this is a complete re-write.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current game feels more like a Beta - the features are there, but they need some refinement and tweaking. To get the negatives out of the way:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The main character looks a bit odd and seems to be doing the Full-Exorcist-Twist sometimes when shooting\\r\\n- The default gamepad controls are just not great, and to fix them you have to edit a config file - but that\\'s really easy to do, and you should probably play with keyboard and mouse anyway (despite my personal peccadillos).\\r\\n- A lot of the environments feel kinda empty\\r\\n- There are only two fullscreen resolution options, and one of them is a resolution I haven\\'t seen since I lost my netbook, so that\\'s... weird\\r\\n\\r\\nBut don\\'t stop reading there - I have a lot of good things to say!\\r\\n\\r\\n+ The developer responded to my original review within a couple hours to tell me how to fix my biggest issue (the control scheme) - I love a developer who responds so quickly and with such grace to criticism, so kudos there!\\r\\n+ The game itself is pretty fun - combining platforming with the rogue-lite formula that made Binding of Isacc amazing is a great idea, and the game itself plays well\\r\\n+ The voice acting and opening scenes are creepy and very well done\\r\\n+ There is enormous variety to be found in this game, with weapons, power-ups, bosses, and room designs. Moreso than a lot of similar projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, The Madness of Little Emma is unpolished. It needs work and could do with better config options and some minor improvement to the pixel art. It\\'s not perfect... but who the hell cares - it\\'s a fun, dark romp that gets better the more you play it. I\\'m still not convinced that it\\'s worth the $9 US asking price, but if you can get it on sale, you absolutely won\\'t regret it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m personally looking forward to continued updates (they seem to hit about every other month, which is a pretty good pace), and I plan to log several more hours with the game. Give it a chance - it\\'ll grow on you!|;|I\\'ve re-written this review due to some very helpful feedback from the developer (see the comments on this review). My initial post was done in a fit of annoyance because the keyboard control was too difficult for me, and although the game detected my controller on OSX the bindings were all wrong and I couldn\\'t see any way to change them. This has now been resolved (again, see comments) and for me the game is much better with a controller.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly though, just the simple fact that the developer was willing to respond helpfully to someone whingeing about a game that they paid \\xc2\\xa30.59 for in the xmas sale automatically makes this recommended. The game itself is pretty good too though!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a roguelike platformer with a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac, which is fine with me because BoI:Rebirth is one of my all-time favourite games. There are unlockable characters, 100\\'s of passive and active pickups, and special/secret rooms (which I\\'ve only scratched the surface of so far). The platformer aspect does give it a different feel from BoI, and it\\'s not quite as polished as that game, but it\\'s overall a very solid game. I\\'ve played a lot of different roguelikes and this is one that I think I\\'ll be playing for quite a while to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nTLDR; Fun game, awesome developer, recommended!|;|The game does borrow a lot from Binding of Isaac, but that fact is misleading. The game, at its core, is a hard bullet hell platformer, and that quality is more important to the game than any similarities is has to Isaac. It\\'s also made with love, even if it\\'s a bit rough around the edges. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes challenging platformers and bullet hell games.|;|I\\'m sure I have a few hundred casual hours left out of this game for the few bucks I payed for it, and while I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever come close to beating it yet, I love it.  It\\'s like a platformer version of Binding of Isaac, which is awesome and unique enough to stand up on it\\'s own.  It\\'s also a lot more challenging too.  Definitely worth it if you like roguelikes at all.|;|First of all, yes, this game is a shameless rip off of Binding of Isaac, even down to things such as music style, boss names and shooting \"spit\" instead of tears. Does this mean it\\'s a bad game? Not at all. If you enjoy BOI you will most likely enjoy this game as well. It has nice art style, smart enemy AI and interesting level design, not to mention plenty of items and secrets to explore. I happened to get it on sale for 2 dollars which was a fantastic price and a good deal. Would I have purchased it at its regular price? Most likely not, I would have just stuck with playing Binding of Isaac. However if you\\'ve 100 percented Isaac and are looking for very similar tribute game, this is a good choice, and is probably the best Isaac clone I have played so far. Obviously if you were not a fan of BOI, don\\'t get this game. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy main complaint about it is the controls. While you are allowed to change the key bindings, aiming and firing is strictly locked to the mouse, which makes playing this game difficult if I am not at home with a physical mouse I can attach to my laptop. If you don\\'t have a physical mouse it makes the game basically unplayable. It would also be nice if it had xbox controller compatibility, however a simpler fix would just be to allow the firing and aiming to be relocated to the keyboard as it is in BOI, creating a smoother gaming experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinal Conclusion? Tired of playing BOI or finished with it and want something similar and engaging? Get this game\\r\\nOtherwise wait for it to go on sale again or skip it.|;|This game plays similar to games like Raze and Fubar: 2d, one hand on wasd to move and another on the mouse to shoot and it manages to keep the same feel as binding of isaac, though it doesn\\'t end up with your character looking widely different from what you started with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re rocking older graphics cards, avoid running the game in fullscreen, it\\'ll crash like no tomorrow.|;|Honestly, whoever made this game made sure no one will enjoy it. it\\'s ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult. The way the story unfolds is amazing and for those who say it\\'s a knockoff of the binding of Isaac, i think it\\'s much better however, it needs more work done, a lot of things don\\'t make any sense. I\\'m certain if the developer takes the suggestions from the players and improves it, a lot of people will enjoy it.|;|Oh, The Madness of Little Emma!\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid game! Still has some kinks to work out but definitely enjoyable. Very difficult and requires more practice than I\\'ve yet put in. I\\'m not going to do a pro/con list, but if you want to hear my extended thoughts on the game, I made a little video you can watch:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0AjRowb4oQ&feature=youtu.be|;|The premise of the game is good but that\\'s where it ends there. It\\'s hindered by a lot of trail and error and I\\'m not just describing playing the game and losing and trying again. When you start the game, you\\'ll get a keyboard showing the controls however you\\'ll later encounter various objects which could be used but then how would I use them? The openning screen doesn\\'t explain that. I had to find that out in the options tab.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe satifying to shoot but you\\'ll encounter the tiny creatures like the spiders and flies but they can\\'t be shot at, they can however be run into which kills them in a gross way, which is confusing. Then there are the floor boards which have a dotty texture on them but they turn out to be spikes which harm the characters. Also trial and error collecting some items as they harm you. which seems pointless, a little too late type of mechanic. Not really nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game offers an item gallery which displays all the items you\\'ve found in the menu but it\\'s just for show. Would have been nice if this was made for in game just in case the player encounters the same items again.|;|Probably the best roguelike on steam.  I would say a cross between the splenky type platformer with the rest influenced from Binding of Isaac and it works very well.  Tons of powerups, great music, and the random generation does a great job.  Bravo!|;|I bought this on sale because the reviews were screaming \"ISAAC CLONE!\". My logic was that I love the Binding of Isaac enough that I\\'d love a clone. Faulty logic, would rather be playing Isaac.|;|This game is simply awesome! \\r\\nI will write this one clearly: it is inspired to The Binding of Isaac or Our Darker Purpose (both wonderful games btw) the same way Salt and Sanctuary is inspired to Dark Souls, so please do not diminish the game calling it a copy of TBoI or ODP. There are a lot of brilliant and original ideas that made me like this game even more than TBoI, like secret stages, a lot of details and fluff, and obviously the plot itself. \\r\\nYou think that I\\'m bs you? Just buy it on sale, no bankruptcy for a couple of bucks!|;|If you like Isaac, you\\'re gonna like this game, I haven\\'t played much but I am already so excited to see what the future will bring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll those items  I haven\\'t collected yet! Boy, I can\\'t wait to find out what they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis basically Isaac but platformer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside is that the bosses (which I\\'ve seen so far) are kind of boring and easily figured out without much to them, but that\\'s only a small complaint!\\r\\n\\r\\nVery good game, love it so far!|;|This game is a hidden gem. It released late December in 2015, and so far as of the writing of this review, doesn\\'t seem to have gotten much attention. I only found out about it because I was digging through steam suggestions based on games similar to another Roguelike, and was suprised there was so little information about it anywhere considering how good it is. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt clearly gets inspiration from Binding of Isaac, but it\\'s a sidescroller. If you like Isaac you\\'ll probably like this too. Seriously, imagine Isaac as a sidescroller, and you have this. If that concept sounds interesting to you, like it did to me, then get this-you won\\'t be disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not just a Binding of Isaac clone though. This game takes an entirely different set of skills, and has it\\'s own kind of charm to it. It\\'s has a bit of a learning curve, especially if you\\'re used to the top down perspective. I found the game quite difficult, but once I got used to the controls and being in a 2D environment it felt a little more forgiving (Except those goddamn spikes). Thankfully the Author is very active and helpful, and constantly updates and works on improving the game, even going as far as writing a minguide to help people figure out certain aspects of the game. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, I\\'m very happy I purchased this game, and I hope it gets a lot more attention than it has so far. It really deserves it.|;|This game is fun, but it feels so unpolished. The last update was over a year ago and it seems like the dev no longer is working on it. It just feels incomplete. Because of that, I can\\'t recommend it despite how much fun it is.|;|TMoLE is not just an Isaac ripoff; it\\'s an Isaac ripoff that pits everyone against each other in super-competitive ladder mode, where people chase after #1 like it\\'s a Willy Wonka golden ticket and then sit on it, preening their feathers in the nucleus of the circle of attention for all to see.  I was in that circle of attention for about 2 weeks, and it was OMG-ly amazing, until some hardcore superfocused ADD-Rainman-savant came along and displaced me.  Now, just a handful of months later, the current high score is closing in on twice my high score as #1.\\r\\n\\r\\nGames that do not make you feel differently aren\\'t games.  TMoLE made me feel three separate emotions during different periods of my playing it:  good, bad, good about feeling good.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m okay with all of that.  I wish more games impacted me that much.|;|Okay when I first saw this little gem I watched the trailer video thing and the movement looked kinda weird and floaty but then a sale happend and I went ahead and got this game...THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY FUN and the controls are really tight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would defenitly pick it up if you like rogulikes.|;|First i want start off saying there isnt much wrong with this game technically, but little things keep adding up in my brain. This game is trying hard to be EXACTLY like The binding of Issac and in that....it fails. Ive fought several bosses that i instantly recgonized in their design and ability from Issac. From the bombs/coins/upgrade stats to the gameplay is all trying so hard to be like Issac and it really shows. Hell you\\'re chracter shoots orbs ot of her mouth in place of tears. I cant tell though if its trying to ripoff issac or trying to be like it but for me the comparisons are so obvious that its not an homage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow having said that, fans of Issac will find something to enjoy in this game. But the problem is if you likie Issac you might as well just play that instead of this game. The two are very similar in their desgin but one is just better at what it does. But it being cheap at $9 makes it hard to say \"Dont buy this game\" You\\'re not losing much if you dont enjoy and at most you will enjoy cause its familiar.|;|A solid roguelite platformer. If you want all or most of the achievements you will have to play a lot of runs and hope RNG is on your side. Some are very RNG reliant and you will only know if you have a chance at them half way or more through a run.|;|Emma is an incredible game. The comparisons to Isaac, Rogue Legacy, and Spelunky are certainly warranted, but that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing. As someone who has well over 500 hours in Isaac and a good amount of hours in Rogue Legacy, I can say with pretty heavy certainty that Emma does it\\'s comparisons justice. It keeps it fresh with new items and large amount of achievements so everything is always a little bit different. Having your level of \"madness\" dictate the difficulty of the game is an interesting touch, and the \"Everything in Terrible\"-esque (Isaac reference, yet again) change after beating False End for the first time is nice as well. After fourteen or so hours I have yet to be bored by the game, and every run is as different, exciting and challening as the last, if not moreso. I look forward to progressing even farther in the game as I traverse through dungeon after dungeon of both literal and figurative misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nTL;DR: This game is amazing, buy it if you like rogue-likes and platformers.|;|this game is amazing!! its a 2d side scrolling version of binding of isaac with better weapons. i never felt cheated by cheap kills like binding of isaac does.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis game is fun and challenging. its worth the $5 price point.|;|This game is similar to The Binding of Isaac thematically and mechanically. If you name a feature in Isaac and ask if it\\'s in Emma, the answer is probably yes. The main difference mechanically is that it\\'s an occasionally tense bullet hell platformer; the main difference thematically is that there\\'s no poop. Hopefully neither of those are dealbreakers for you, because everything that makes Isaac addictive--easily digested room-to-room pacing, unlockable characters and boss encounters, tons of stackable items--this game does just as well. Between the two, I think Emma is a little more twitchy and challenging; in Isaac you\\'re sometimes able to become a godlike being of destruction that clears boss fights instantly, and so far, at least, Emma is a little less forgiving. If you put any significant amount of time into Isaac or Spelunky you\\'ll be happy. I got it while it was on sale but the non-sale price point is still a good deal.|;|I reccomend it 100%, without giving too much about it away; the gameplay is exciting and challenging, the art and music are fantastic, there\\'s a wonderfully done eerie atmosphere, the controls are spot-on, and overall this is a really nice hidden gem on the Steam store. While its similarities to the Binding of Isaac are quite present you\\'ll be having so much fun playing the game that you won\\'t even notice.|;|I\\'ve got about 4 hours into the game and it\\'s just OKAY.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPros:  Great BoI adaptation.  If you like platforming and BoI, this is the game for you.  Plenty of new pickups and characters to unlock and challenging to boot.  Definitely a must if you\\'re one of those perfectionist gamers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:  Very unbalanced.  The characters I\\'ve unlocked have pretty cruddy starting stats and the game is SUPER control twichy.  It\\'s difficult to drop bombs in the game (I usually have to push the button 2 or 3 times and before you ask, it\\'s not a hardware problem).  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you like a great challenge, don\\'t mind spending a few bucks, and searching for the NVIDA patch (it\\'s in the forums, took me about 30 minutes to find it), pick this one up.  But if you\\'re one of those folks that get easily frustrated over mechanics and \"get gud\" scenarios, stay away.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBarely got a thumbs up from me.|;|I seem to be addicted to this game, despite my frustration for how it just drops me into bullet-hell. I find myself wanting more control over which power-ups I receive, and more opportunity for clever escape. Some rooms are dead-simple,  while others are pretty much impossible.. unless you have the right power-ups, of course. Frustrated but addicted is bad, so I cannot recommend the game.|;|The Madness of Little Emma is a good game, however it\\'ll take you a while to actualy start getting somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madness of Little Emma is a game inspired by Binding of Isaac, and takes a different approach on it by making it into a sidescrolling game (is sidescrolling the right word here? I\\'m not sure myself, so please let me know if it isn\\'t!)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nnow, as always, let\\'s start with the good stuff:\\r\\n\\r\\n+ the story, while it has a few similarities to BoI (which is prefer to call nod, because there\\'s only 2 noticeable one and they\\'re minor details), is very unique and intriguing, however, I cannot say anything about the ending as I have yet to reach them.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ the game is easy to grasp, you shoot at enemies with left click to kill them, and you place bombs with right click to break walls and other objects (or just blow up enemies), however, being able to effectively doge enemies and survive for more than 3 floors is where the game starts becomming difficult, so if you\\'ve never played a game like this before, you\\'ll suck for quite a while.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ the music isn\\'t anything special IMO, but it works really well with the grim tone the game has.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile this is all great, I have a few issues with this game:\\r\\n\\r\\n- such a game should have some sort of wiki, which it does not.\\r\\nHowever, the game is less than a month old and the community is pretty small, so I can understand it not having a wiki yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n- the game becomes repetitive really quickly, becasue of the small collection of items and the fact that there\\'s only one character, and for a game that can take a while to get good at, that is not a good thing\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, the game is fun, but I\\'d say that the game currently costs a bit too much for what it has as of right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal rating: 6/10|;|Imagine The Binding of Isaac....but it\\'s a platformer!!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a great idea, but unfortunately poorly executed. Sorry, I wanted this to succeed, but it just didn\\'t click for me.|;|got this on 0.90$ sale. pretty good but nothing too special. its alright, but its not that fun after you beat the normal game; i\\'ve only played arena after that. still good though|;|It looks like a fun platformer, but the controls make it nearly impossible to play.  It uses an FPS layout in the sense of WASD to move, and the mouse aims. This seems akward for this type of 2d game in my mind. The \"partrial controller support\" tag didn\\'t seem to be accurate in my case either. If you\\'re cool  with keyboard / mouse for this kind of game you might enjoy it though.|;|2D rogue like game , with score ladder .\\r\\ndiferent ending that are hard to get .\\r\\nreally cool game , give a try|;|this game is literally unplayable, i had to restart steam to boot another game because steam thought it was open but it wasn\\'t and it wasn\\'t in task manager ._. nice... i also remember it being bad when i bought it ages ago so probably just don\\'t buy this lol|;|This game has some of the worst controls I have seen in a 2D sidescroller.\\r\\n\\r\\n- controller mapping is broken and unintuitive, cant remap the controls\\r\\n- keyboard and mouse controls are kinda delayed, the shots dont fly where the cursor is, its slightly off....\\r\\n\\r\\nNot being able to control the character is a major problem and absolutely not worth buying, even for 2 bucks!\\r\\n|;|Binding of Isaac if Binding of Isaac was a platformer and not good|;|\\r\\nLike binding of isaac but extremely slow and tedious. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m still looking for a good isaac style platformer.|;|ok so how did no one mention there is no fullscreen? like really this the full release of the game with no fullscreen or decent controller support?!?! its not even good its just BOI but with bad controls i dont get why people are praising this game.|;|The Madness of Little Emma is one of those games that was compared to another (in this case, The Binding of Issac), and that caused me to skip it for a while. Luckily, I ended up picking this up on impulse during a sale, and I have found that I like it a lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there are some parallels to Issac, in that you have a character with a tragic backstory going a bit crazy, a plethora of characters to choose from, randomly generating maps, and loads of items you can collect. The thing that seperates it is that it becomes its own game as you play, with everything from the sidescrolling layout to the types of items keeping you wanting to play. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as layout goes, you have a map on the top of the screen that shows you where you are and all adjoining rooms. It also tracks your progress and it keeps a rudimentary tab on some items you miss. It will not, for example, tell you that you missed a treasure chest but it will inform you that you left coins or a heart behind. This helps a lot, too, and especially when you are hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have specific abiilities on the lefthand side that can be powered up in a few ways, with these basically controlling your strength, how fast you shoot, and your luck. Along with that, you have hearts that showcase your health, and that are removed in halves or wholesdepending on the enemy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to attacking, you have the left click shot and the right clickbomb. Different characters impact this differently; for example, you can unlock a little ghost girl that can shoot through walls. Still, this is basic - in a good way - meaning you do not have to worry about convoluted controls. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room layout has a few options, from the randomly spawned enemy rooms to rooms with games of chance, challenges, rooms to spend coins (or hearts sometimes), and bonus rooms. There is at least one bonus room per level, so you basically get an item for winning each time. There are also RIP rooms, wherein you pick up a large item as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as what you can find here, you have 100s of items that you can get and that can be stacked on top of one another, so you can become more and more powerful as you roam the game. For example, you may find a cloud that causes all your enemies to stick to it and a hat that gives you spikes if attacked from behind. You may find bugs to surround and protect you or an assault raven that hits baddies. You can also get shot upgrades, giving you bomb shots, stronger ones, stun ones, and on. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are loads of enemies in the game, too, giving you a variety of things to run into. From the basic moths that get in the way to the more complex enemies that shoot lightning or teleport, you have things to figure out and mater. The bosses also come in a variety of forms, from flying to those that spawn little helpers to snakes and the like. I like the boss fights because they are straight forward - there is a bar across the top depecting the boss health in read. Take it and you win. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also two modes of play. You can play the ladder, wherein you can see other people\\'s scores and compete by adding onto yours (this accumulates and does not go game by game), or you can play casual. \\r\\n\\r\\nI like this game quite a bit - it can be a good way to kill a few minutes or to set for an hour or two.|;|I have over 900+ hours on Binding of Isaac, and I can easily say it\\'s my favorite game. Madness of Little Emma does a fantastic job bringing back the love I have for Isaac since I started to play. The level of difficulty can be comparable, and the learning curve is the same. I hate to say it, but to me, it\\'s Binding of Isaac 2 with improvements. It\\'s a worthy pick up, and certainly worth the current price on Steam. I have, as I write this, about an hour, and can very plainly say, I found a new favorite game. If you like BOI, get this.|;|I love the graphics and story. I wasn\\'t expecting such a good short prologue that really got into the head of a girl losing her mind. It\\'s a hard game,but satisfying. I will say the movement of the character feels a little fast to me but that\\'s my only \\'complaint.\\'|;|i started playing this with trepidation. thinking i could not possibly enjoy how rough around the edges it seemed.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow i cant stop playing it. it scratches the itch of playing one more time to fulfil that hope of getting a proper build and finishing a playthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\njust right amount of frustration. very little resources for figuring things out. but thats ok.|;|This game has a lot to offer for a small price tag. It goes very cheap during steam sales and I was able to pick it up for $.8 and oh man is it worth that price!|;|I honestly got more out of this game then I expected to. Bought it on sale and it filled the itch that I needed to scratch for an easy to pick up but challenging to master roguelike. I think this game is very fun for the genre, you can tell the develeper put a large amount of time into balancing the game and all the different items in it. Well worth the money spent for the hours I played.|;|Imagine Binding of Isaac but a platformer, fun, and actually difficult.\\r\\nPlay it, it\\'s fun.|;|This game is a gem. At first I thought to expect a clone of The Binding of Isaac but it really excels in many ways and is a lot more fun to me. The art style is fitting, the music fits the mood of the game really well. The game can sometimes be extremely difficult to excel and sometimes easy. All depending on what toys you can find in each play through. Overall it\\'s a great game to play if you like action, strategy, and especially platformer games.\\r\\n\\r\\n8/10|;|I haven\\'t played much of this game, but I am already addicted.|;|Basically Binding of Isaac but platformer.

            "Round-trip:  i love games like the madness of little emma where you play a run at a time and try to get farther and farther defeat difficult bosses unlock powerful and fun items and discover secret areas and challenges this game fits that [UNK] fairly well but i cant recommend picking up this game for a number of reasons 1 unbalanced items the majority of items you will come across are pretty useless and sometimes im not sure what determines this picking up items increases your madness stat by 1 a stat which makes the game harder im not sure how exactly the difficulty increase works im not sure if it scales with your madness level or just increases the difficulty once you hit a certain threshold but this mechanic encourages the player to pass up on most items due not only to their [UNK] effects but due to the negative consequences of picking up a large number of items over time that being said there are a select few items that are really really good if you manage to find a combination of two or three items that work super well together they can carry you for an entire run 2 stats rely on rng this is a pretty common aspect of similar games but it doesn’t work very well in the madness of little emma your main source of stat boosts which you wont get very far without many of are random [UNK] scattered throughout the game sometimes they drop from enemies sometimes you get them for clearing a [UNK] room sometimes you get them from treasure chests regardless of how you get them there is a major flaw to this mechanic the most common [UNK] type green has a chance to lower your stats with how rare all [UNK] are and with how quickly the difficulty of this game picks up you need as many stat upgrades as you can possibly find so not taking green [UNK] isnt a reliable option you get one guaranteed purple [UNK] increases a random stat per boss fight but sometimes thats all youll get on the first floor which to me is an instant restart and its even worse when that stat upgrade happens to be luck instead of damage or fire rate some items will grant stats too but as mentioned above a lot of items youll come across are simply not worth taking 3 run ending rooms when you get farther in floors 6 usually you can run into rooms that will completely ruin you if you dont have an incredibly overpowered item loadout most normal enemies arent a problem but get a room of the wrong champion enemies and theres little you can do the worst champion effects are explosive shots slowing aura which sometimes comes with another champion effect and double damage shots and these can be especially bad if you get a room with a lot of champion enemies which honestly isnt too uncommon 4 unavoidable damage when you start playing this game you won’t run into a ton of this but the farther you get in the game the higher the chance you’ll come across rooms where there’s so much going on there’s legitimately nothing you can do to maneuver out of the way of enemy attacks even if you’re completely overpowered minus one combination of 2 items that actually completely breaks the game in your favor run ending rooms are still likely to beat you up a little bit the game tends to be pretty generous with dropping hearts for the player to pick up but then you could enter another room where you’re guaranteed to take damage and it won’t have really helped much these are my main gripes with this game but it’s enough to make the game almost entirely unfun other than what i’ve listed i have had the game crash on me once but i did have it open for about 7 hours straight before that happened so that could easily have had something to do with it in any case there is definitely some fun to be had here and i actually really love the arena mode a whole lot but the main game itself becomes incredibly painful to play the difference between the madness of little emma and many other roguelikes is that skill and knowledge of [UNK] patterns can only get you so far you have to be incredibly lucky to have a shot at making real progress in this game because of this [UNK] on luck you can try to get a good run started for hours and still not get anywhere and then suddenly have two perfect items fall into your lap one after the other that will grant you a win if you’re interested in trying out this game it has been pretty heavily discounted in the past and i would assume it’s likely to be on sale again at some point if you’re still on the fence about picking it up with the steam refund you’ve got a two hour window of opportunity to try it out for yourself a bit and see if you’ll end up enjoying it more than i did so i do encourage anyone interested to at least try the game before writing it off furthermore there is a demo for this game available on steam to try out without any worries of refunding i would definitely recommend starting with the demo [UNK] madness of little emma is one of the few roguelikes that caught my attention and didnt let go it certainly has lots of things in common with other roguelike games but it feels completely different mainly due to the fact that this is a platformer with rather satisfying movement physics the game has a good learning curve it doesnt tell you anything about its mechanics you have to play observe and note the changes first couple of hours i had difficulty getting past 1st stage 60 hours later the main reason for not reaching the 5th or [UNK] ending is that i made some mistake early on surely [UNK] has some rough edges for example the cursor is somewhat bleak and sometimes i lose it in the background but the developer is constantly working on the game fixing bugs and adding new free content in conclusion a great game for its price challenging but [UNK] is a perfect example of everything an [UNK] game should be its obviously the binding of isaac as a platformer but it successfully captures the mood feel fun and design philosophy of isaac the madness mechanics and the item pool do a good job capturing the feel of isaac without feeling like a [UNK] theres great music great enemy and boss design varied items and tons of secret levels and oh yeah its fun and really does feel like youre playing a new version of isaac cons game balance isnt perfect for some items characters champion enemies and bosses neither is [UNK] but this game definitely occasionally has me going that room wasnt fair while isaac didnt also its hard to tell what some items [UNK] the theme and collectibles of binding of isaac mix it with the 2d platformer aspect of [UNK] or rogue legacy and you’ve pretty much got the madness of little emma it’s difficult – some rooms and bosses can get downright [UNK] with the amount of fire they’re throwing at you and even some fairly early enemies can be extremely [UNK] – especially ones that make quick leaps at you [UNK] [UNK] you in a corner the items you pick up tend towards passive bonuses allowing for [UNK] stacking combos if you get lucky anyway – there’s plenty of [UNK] items although i have yet to find anything actively negative like accidentally picking up [UNK] milk or cursed eye in isaac the music is good and the pixel graphics work pretty well importantly as of this writing september [UNK] the game is 80 off – a mere [UNK] at that price i’d say that it’s a great pickup for anyone who enjoys [UNK] of the games that i mentioned in my first [UNK] is how it should be done instead of [UNK] your money up the [UNK] of some early access scum buy this game i bought in on release day played through it had a good time but that was not it the dev dude keeps updating it as frequently as i get disappointed by early access games and thats about once a week i could see how the game improved with every patch and now its better than ever before so that guy published a finished perfectly fine game and now he even keeps updating it with new totally free content its sad that there only so few people who are playing it if you love rogue like as much as i do then this is a must buy give the dev dude you god damn [UNK] i were [UNK] on concept alone this is probably an a for me that concept being that of a [UNK] twin stick platformer featuring a [UNK] cartoon atmosphere and tons and tons of unlockables obviously heavily influenced by the binding of isaac everywhere from concept to theme to mechanics all the way down the line no [UNK] to find its still a winning formula her even while i wish it was more original in some aspects its still a fun ride i would say the underlying [UNK] mechanics are solid but not spectacular to elaborate on that point a bit i just feel that the running around shooting etc feels functional here as opposed to [UNK] fluid or satisfying luckily the vast number of unlockables and different playstyles and upgrades makes the experience a plus 1 and the fact that i got this for just under 2 bucks makes me smile and shake my head at some of my other purchases [UNK] good music and i like the unique binding of isaac adaptation however the movement alone is enough to deter me away from playing this game it is beyond clunky i really had high hopes because i love binding of isaac and this is similar except in platformer format but the movement need to be smoother for me to pick it up [UNK] since the recent patches i now no longer continue to have the problem when trying to open the game it will now open from steam and the desktop so that was fixed pretty quickly sure the game is influenced by other roguelike titles such as isaac but the one thing that this game doesnt do is hold your hand a 2d roguelike platformer that easily can stand as one of the tougher roguelikes on the market from the couple of hours ive spent in the game hardly do i even come close to seeing any 1 of the 4 endings mentioned little emma requires skill simply put youll get damage ups but the enemy placement and mini boss rooms range from easy to dodge to this room is the worst some of the late game mobs including these crying women who start [UNK] you with explosions that are hard to track are just a pain to deal with if you even make it that far with no damage is it a bad game though absolutely not because its still a very interesting roguelike the story involves two children emma [UNK] and her little brother [UNK] who survive pretty much on their own one day emma [UNK] up to find [UNK] missing as well as blood all over the room as she looks around she [UNK] a trap door similar to [UNK] adventure into the depths below under a [UNK] assuming [UNK] has been taken or [UNK] down there she soon follows as far as story its not strong i mean it holds a very similar take of the isaac story that people have accustomed themselves to but instead of a [UNK] mother youre the loving big sister whether [UNK] went down there on his own is still unknown still having a hard time beating it once i know nothing about the endings controls are pretty standard and easy to understand at least for mouse and keyboard the room you spawn in shows you your controls a to move left d to right w to jump as well as space and d to go down platforms you can jump through you can also use the arrow keys for these commands as well you can also rebind keys if you have a more comfortable control scheme to use [UNK] items you press e [UNK] items unlike space bar items in isaac require money to use instead of having to clear rooms it is here to prevent any of the items from seeming too overpowered such as an item that freezes everything in the room or turns back time by a couple of actions you aim with your mouse left click to shoot balls of spit and right click to drop bombs itll be best to have a mouse that you can change sensitivity on because there are moments where its hard to connect your hits while the keyboard controls are fine the controller support is less [UNK] even though its still supported every time ive tried to play with the controller i just put it back down because it feels weird you also dont have as much freedom with aiming than you do with a mouse you also cant rebind controller buttons so right now whatever your buttons are mapped to thats what youll have to deal with the worst [UNK] of this release is the current technical issues some issues like what im having is i cant open the game from steam or desktop i simply have to go into my [UNK] common find little emma and open up the win [UNK] file that then opens up a command window and does its thing before the game opens slightly sloppy and a small hassle to play a game you also need [UNK] installed for some reason these issues dont prevent me from still enjoying the game but i can understand why people buying and installing would be confused as to why their game doesnt open in the end emma is still an enjoyable experience if youre looking for a roguelike that is a little more tougher and requires more skill than rng rng still matters of course but its almost treated like its a second thought instead of a primary mechanic this game will not hold your hand it will not pay you kindly with optimistic words of victory it will wreck you and frustrate you but not because its unfair because you require the skill to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead if the previous negative [UNK] about this game get fixed itll only continue to show how valuable this game is to the roguelike [UNK] this game is very very derivative of several games to the point where the intro made me think is this binding of isaac told from [UNK] perspective at first but you know theme and general feel [UNK] or not sometimes you have to respect solid [UNK] this is very nicely done definately worth a [UNK] despite some of its flaws low budget and how [UNK] it draws from its obvious [UNK] emma is a [UNK] made game with enough fun and unique ideas to make it a worthy addition to the [UNK] genre as someone with over 1000 hours in the binding of isaac games ive been curious to try the madness of little emma for awhile now since isaac appears to be its most obvious influence im writing this review of my initial impressions of the game after only having played a few runs with my latest being a fairly decent one i made it to misery and managed to clear some sort of [UNK] optional dungeon im not sure how close to the end i made it but i feel i experienced enough of the game to give me a good idea of what kind of experiences i can expect from it while the game draws heavily from its isaac inspiration the most obvious difference is its [UNK] perspective and the inclusion of some basic platforming elements if isaac is a variation on [UNK] dungeon crawling emma is a variation on metroid the movement feels good due to the games focus on bullethell type enemies more so than isaac even the ability to jump dodge and weave between enemy bullets is crucial and game controls quite well in that regard while i normally prefer to play platformers with a controller and the game does kind of support it but not very well mouse and keyboard seems to make the most sense for this game the art style is quite dark and lacks the silly [UNK] humor found in the binding of isaac most of the early enemies are just some [UNK] insects but some of the later enemies are downright lovecraftian [UNK] of [UNK] slime and [UNK] though there is some humor in the game most of it seems pretty [UNK] and grim and the music which is mostly [UNK] and atmospheric adds to that aesthetic the spirit of the gameplay is very much like isaac players play as emma or one of several unlockable characters and traverse [UNK] dungeon maps maps are randomly populated with a series of rooms upon entering a room the doors lock behind you until all the enemies have been cleared also like in isaac death is permanent and each run starts you over from scratch aside from any unlockables you managed to get from your previous run the enemies themselves seem quite varied in both appearance and attack abilities some fire bullets in a wide range of patterns and effects some chase you down in varying ways through walls [UNK] from the sky teleporting across the room etc some spawn other enemies some fire beams and some are frankly just hard to describe im actually tempted to say there might even be more individual enemy variety in this game than in isaac in addition to enemies some rooms have chests of varying quality brown gray gold and red in rare cases some of which require a bomb to open the are also spike traps and [UNK] walls secret rooms and occasionally colored [UNK] which grant the player stat buffs or debuffs when consumed sort of like [UNK] in isaac each floor contains one treasure room which randomly draws from a large pool of [UNK] [UNK] items over 250 one boss room and sometimes one or more special rooms like a sacrifice room sacrificing [UNK] for [UNK] maybe items arenas fighting off waves of enemies for loot shops which contain [UNK] chests and a creepy [UNK] skeleton man who doesnt understand the meaning of personal space and what i call hanging rooms which feature a girl hanging by a [UNK] who drops an item when you shoot her of the items ive found so far some seem familiar and some unique in my last run i found an item which caused friendly ghosts to spawn around me and chase down enemies like blue flies in isaac a helpful robot friend that [UNK] my body and shot down enemy projectiles with a laser an item which made my tears larger and stronger when i stood still and an item that made me [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] its not yet clear to me whether or not emma features the same level of item synergy found in isaac though i would assume it does to some degree or another combat is only [UNK] similar to that in isaac while emma also fires white [UNK] projectiles or maybe its spit the high movement speed ability to jump and the 360 degree aiming makes for a much faster and potentially more hectic experience than in isaac after the first few floors the bullet hell aspects of this game seriously ramp up whereas isaac is more focused on [UNK] enemy shots and carefully placing yourself between them emma seems to require more twitch reflexes and simply running the fuck away from situations when they get too [UNK] the later levels can become seriously overwhelming in that regard so much so that i find it difficult to imagine that player should be expected to be able to dodge all of the shots instead of simply taking it on the [UNK] and using your generous invincibility frames to better position yourself around some cover on the one hand this seems somewhat reasonable despite the game being fairly [UNK] when it comes to health and especially health upgrades on the other one of the things i love so much about isaac is the [UNK] of enemy attacks and being able to avoid damage simply by being smart bosses are also a big part of the game and so far ive only found a couple that remind of those from isaac one was a [UNK] snake monster that bounced around the room the other was a big face that split into multiple smaller faces when enough damage had been dealt to it so far other than those two i havent seen any others which immediately reminded me of isaac bosses that said i cant say i found most of the bosses i fought to be particularly fun or compelling one was a giant fly that [UNK] [UNK] around the room occasionally popping out two smaller flies that would each fire a single projectile and small flies dropped hearts which seemed unnecessary given how easy the fight was in the optional [UNK] dungeon i stumbled across the boss was a large heart that bounced around the room [UNK] out bullets in an [UNK] pattern which would split into more large [UNK] hearts as it got damaged repeating this process until 8 or so of these large hearts had been defeated of the bosses i encountered my favorite was called [UNK] who looked like a giant [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] and flew [UNK] the screen [UNK] bullets and [UNK] the room requiring some interesting dodging to avoid being hit while admittedly i havent even seen half of the bosses in the game yet im a little disappointed in the boss rooms which so far have been empty [UNK] rooms that dont seem to take advantage of one of the games main mechanics the platforming youre mostly just running back and forth across the floor dodging projectiles and hopping over the bosses when they get too close theres no [UNK] to fights from what ive seen though again its possible i just didnt get to see those fights on the later levels the game somewhat manages to remedy this by spawning bosses in the normal rooms which makes more a much interesting fight i just wish platforming had been more of a consideration for those early boss fights to keep them from feeling so dull overall aside from my complaint about boss fights and a few bugs i noticed during the screen transitions i quite enjoyed my time with this game emma manages to wear its inspiration on its [UNK] without being overshadowed by it and has its own unique brand of fun charm fans of the binding of isaac rogue legacy or even terraria will probably find more than a little to love [UNK] dont have much to add that others havent already said its got a lot of similarities to binding of isaac but as other reviewers have noted it doesnt feel like a [UNK] there are a handful of new and interesting ideas in the game and theres more than enough content to entertain you for a dozen or more hours much more if you want to see what the unlocks are find new power ups and see the various endings there are unfair moments that will frustrate you and the rare bug in 150 or so times ive done a playthrough so far ive had 3 games where a bug prevented me from continuing but overall the game feels pretty good even if maybe its a bit unbalanced at times its disappointing that more people havent [UNK] this game i think its much better than the numbers are indicating only [UNK] reviews as of this post maybe some folks are turned off by the [UNK] price i think i got it on sale for just a couple dollars myself but my opinion on that might be a special case since i dont buy any games over 10 bucks as a rule after all i have about a hundred games i havent even installed yet anytime i think i want a game more than 10 i remind myself of that fact my strongest [UNK] of the game is simply my number of hours in game 64 at this point and still going that being said i dont feel like the replay value is anywhere near binding of isaac but maybe that doesnt really say much since i have about a thousand hours in that game across the original [UNK] [UNK] if you like difficult platformers that have tons of things to unlock and discover then this is certainly worth a try if you do decide to buy this try to give it a couple of hours before your verdict my own opinion of the game has only improved with more [UNK] amazing game all its own once you get past its similarities with other games ive played this a fair bit and stream it often and intend to carry on doing so while its obvious that its heavily influenced by other games such as the binding of isaac the [UNK] has clearly defined this as a seperate game adding other mechanics not see in similar games [UNK] it from the rest i enjoy it immensely the game having huge replayability and a ton of unlockables with more to come hopefully challenging and fun people really need to give this more than a few minutes playing and complaining cant wait for more [UNK] binding of isaac as a platformer downright to the dark setting artwork and general gameplay if you liked binding of isaac and like platformers youre going to enjoy this the only thing that can be [UNK] are the controls ive never been a fan of platformers with mouse aim so if you are bothered by it you better maybe playing something else also the game is a little rough on the edges the [UNK] between the screens sometimes can cause a [UNK] effect on the screen because the camera goes up and down really fast a couple times before [UNK] in the new character position also the game over screen could be a little more [UNK] out [UNK] the player to press any key to go to the main screen i found myself waiting for visual feedback every time i died lol but nonetheless is a fun game like i said in the beginning if you like boi and platformers youre going to like this game for [UNK] game really wants to be the binding of isaac there was a good amount of effort put into making it and i did find myself wanting to keep playing at times but it really lacks polish character movement feels a bit too fast for precision but too slow to navigate some of the more [UNK] designed rooms with way too many walls that form [UNK] paths to the next room character progression feels slow and unrewarding and youll feel underpowered in most runs theres a pretty large pool of items but so many of them have underwhelming effects so the few items that the game gives you in an average run barely give you any power too many similar status effect modifiers and worthless active items and not enough damage the game is so [UNK] that youll be lucky if you find a damage up after two floors it doesnt help that a lot of enemies are really [UNK] theres even a few items that are so bad that they can end a run on their own a significant number of chests spawn on top of large [UNK] of spikes and low [UNK] so youre pretty much guaranteed to lose life trying to get the items inside theres also chests that are only [UNK] by bomb jumping the game does not drop enough hearts to compensate for the forced damage chests its usually not even worth it to try since chests barely give anything good a lot of them only give 1 coin or 1 [UNK] consumables dont drop enough in general you only get enough coins in a typical run to maybe buy two items from shops and thats only if you avoid using active items altogether which have coin costs that can go up to 4 coins per single use theres an optional secret area that only spawns if youre holding 50 coins and youll most likely never see it unless you play the character that starts with 30 coins and still avoid buying items some enemies and projectiles are hard to see in some of the later areas red orbs on a dark orange background or pale homing skulls on a light brown background and the same skulls also look exactly the same as some projectiles that are created by player items so you dont even know which are good and which are bad sometimes arena challenge rooms can spawn enemies a few pixels away from you so you have no time to react or even directly on your character if youre playing the flying character the flying character gets stuck on slopes instead of moving along them [UNK] bosses can have a [UNK] effect on each segment that instantly [UNK] out your entire inventory of consumables regular enemies can have that [UNK] too so you tend to lose your bombs and coins a lot but at least you have a chance to save a coin or two in regular rooms the mouse isnt locked to the game window in windowed mode you cant rebind the bomb key for some reason a room in an early area that can spawn a dozen high hp mobs in a small space that fly through walls closing in on you is almost guaranteed death on most characters theres bullet hell rooms that are near impossible to survive in made worse by your imprecise movement mini bosses with modifiers that can [UNK] you in said bullet hell rooms theres a bunch of rooms in general that feel like [UNK] traps that are almost guaranteed to end a run you cant skip them and it wouldnt matter anyway because you dont know which rooms are death traps until you enter them 90 of the rooms in this game are brain dead easy and a dozen or so that are so ridiculous that youll lose 5 full hearts just trying to get a couple hits in enemy bullets have infinite range but your characters shot range is very short sometimes its impossible to even get near an enemy because theres 3 or 4 enemies near the ceiling that never stop shooting an absurd amount of projectiles and youre just stuck in a corner [UNK] back and forth to dodge the [UNK] [UNK] of projectiles i had a lot more fun in the separate arena mode than the main mode since its a lot more generous with its items and buffs not to mention you get a choice of multiple items instead of getting stuck with whatever garbage rng throws at you in the main mode theres item synergies and special item interactions in this game but youd never know if you only played the main mode finding all four monster [UNK] combines them into a single larger familiar [UNK] la [UNK] super bum that shoots large [UNK] lasers for example it feels like a lot of secrets are tied to rng some of these complaints were minor nitpicks but theres definitely a lot of unfair or unpolished design that [UNK] the entire experience a lot of my deaths felt like they werent my fault and most runs arent very fun because the game refuses to give you any damage buffs the game could be really good with some more development time and proper balancing but i cant recommend it in its current state it seems development has ended [UNK] fun and well made i love the art style the sound effects the items and characters my favourite is [UNK] because shes op i wholeheartedly recommend this to any roguelike [UNK] was quite happy to see this gem made it to steam and bought it immediately its a rather obvious [UNK] of the binding of isaac and its influences youll recognize a lot of things quickly if you are familiar with boi there is however a crucial difference the madness of little emma is a platformer which adds a refreshing spin to it there are already plenty of items in this game and it is possible to see what they do by pressing esc and going into the items menu which removes a bit of the guessing game and makes it easier to learn the ropes as far as the enemies are [UNK] most patterns are easy to learn though not surprisingly there are some that need some getting used to as well as those that very likely need some tweaking theres also an insanity meter in this game the higher it goes the faster enemies become and the earlier more difficult [UNK] spawn personally i only experienced a glitch and one [UNK] but im fairly confident that those will be [UNK] down quickly since a look at the discussions shows that the dev is [UNK] closely with the community to get rid of those problems this game also comes with a very good soundtrack as far as i am [UNK] so all in all i heartily recommend it finally this is my first review so i hope i managed to touch upon the important [UNK] great game kind of short but its just the right amount of time for a busy [UNK] guy like myself im very happy with this [UNK] i know everyone has said a lot of good things about this game so id like to point out something different one thing that really annoys me about platforming games rougelike ones in particular is when the dev doesnt take the time to get the [UNK] mechanic solid this game [UNK] that very well you move around the screen at a good pace not too fast not too slow you wont find yourself running into damage because your character failed to react to your movements also you dont continue to slide around after [UNK] i rarely found myself getting frustrated at not being able to reach a ledge and at no time was it due to my character just continuing to move and fall off due to bad mechanics big kudos on [UNK] the basics of gameplay a lot of devs tend to overlook [UNK] changed some of the [UNK] and updated it a little bit the madness of little emma is a nice little action platformer if youre a fan of the binding of isaac tboi it should kind of feel familiar as it is heavily inspired by it at times normally i dont write reviews but this game has so few players that i feel i have to [UNK] is the madness of little [UNK] the madness of little emma is an 2d action platformer set in a dark world as in tboi you have one item room on every floor there are sacrifice rooms though theyre not working like the ones in tboi shops dare rooms secrets and some more you also have to beat a boss at the end of the floor to go down deeper and deeper until you reach the final boss but most things still are working quite different than in tboi so [UNK] isnt just an tboi as an action platformer but is its own game and has its own appeal [UNK] could be [UNK] [UNK] some items are really good and fun to play with but most of the items dont really help you or worse make your run worse while tboi also had the same kind of items i feel that they had more use after having played some more i dont think the items are that big of a problem anymore i probably expected too much of them but unlike in tboi in this game most items wont make your run [UNK] relies more on the skill of the player than having great items which doesnt mean that good items cant save your run example for bad items i was really disappointed in the [UNK] it looked really nice in the trailer but when i obtained it it just felt bad having to fight enemies with a shield is pure horror as you can hit them twice mostly or even just once and you have to wait for the [UNK] to return to you before you can throw it again while their shield is back up example for good items the raven i just love that little ugly bird he can fly through walls and instantly attacks the first enemy in sight while you can still shoot and he does quite some damage always nice to have and it makes the run much easier [UNK] bits [UNK] like really really hard maybe even harder than tboi but thats ok i like challenging games after having said that you can still beat the [UNK] on your first day playing the good thing is that this game doesnt end there it more or less just begins i also like the fact that you can control the [UNK] by collecting madness from items or the [UNK] girl the more madness you have the harder the game gets like tboi elite enemies also get a lot more common if you beat the [UNK] the first time but there are things right now that i feel are to difficult of course it could be my limited skill but i find most of the elite bosses to hard for example elite liquid sisters are taking up 23 of the [UNK] and the bubbles they shoot which explode into more shots are taking the rest of the room some bosses are easier than others and you have to get used to most of them and even then its still a challenge [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] you gain points by how well you played and by how far you could go in your playthrough note that every playthrough counts as long as you play the ladder mode the ladder gets reset every two weeks at the time im writing this review [UNK] it seems like the ladder wasnt [UNK] since i wrote this review the first timei [UNK] randomly generated dungeons including which items rooms shops etc you [UNK] every new run just feels kind of unique and refreshing you always want to find out which item you get on the floor but even though i love that there are 250 items in the game some of which you have to unlock if you havent unlocked enough it feels like you get the same items again and again maybe its just me but i get baseball [UNK] like 50 of my runs [UNK] [UNK] you get to know the basics of the game and thats it not even the [UNK] of the characters you can unlock are explained so you have to find everything out yourself or use the wiki it feels like starting tboi all over again and i love it if you want to get into this game i suggest you check out the official beginner guide by the [UNK] [UNK] you can find it in the steam guides it explains the basics and helps a lot for the start [UNK] [UNK] i just like how they work most of the time you have to pay some small amount to use the item in tboi it would probably suck but here it works really well [UNK] like tboi there are different endings items bosses etc to unlock i love unlocking things after all [UNK] is a fun indie game and it still gets patches from time to time so it has the potential to get better and better it may not be a flawless game and sometimes even a little bit too hard but if you have fun with tboi you pretty sure will have fun with [UNK] also supporting an indie developer feels [UNK] madness of little emma even though it was heavily influenced by the binding of isaac gameplay is very different well its obvious because emma is a platformer game although the game is a bit unpolished at this moment its still very enjoyable the most noticeable thing is that theres no much variation in room layouts of course theyre different from level to level but you can see the same layout on the same level pretty often but oh well its just a matter of time of course its really hard and you may need a bit of a time to get used to it especially its important to get used to spikes theyre a major game element the music is pretty nice episode [UNK] theme is probably my [UNK] i enjoy this game i dont feel like it offers much more than many of the other [UNK] ive played i feel like its good but i dont feel like its for me that being said that doesnt mean its not for you its definitely fast paced has an enjoyable environment and atmosphere and requires some point awareness at times do i recommend this game yes not for me but i wouldnt tell you not to try [UNK] is the [UNK] form of [UNK] that said calling the madness of little emma a clone of the binding of isaac would be giving it too little credit it very obviously draws heavy influence using a very similar hud almost identical means of attacking and even all but [UNK] some of the enemies and bosses from tboi including directly [UNK] names im looking at you [UNK] despite the striking resemblance to isaac the platformer aspect helps to keep the gameplay fresh [UNK] helps to think of the madness of little emma as what it is a standalone game and not as an isaac [UNK] the side view as opposed to a topdown view offers possibilities for interesting items and enemies such as giving your shots weight allowing you to shoot in arcs and the twin sisters boss which drops from the ceiling above you jumping around to dodge enemies and shots is difficult and a little frustrating at first but i enjoy it more and more as i play the [UNK] enemies on the third floor are surprisingly fun to fight in narrow hallways with [UNK] just low enough to evade damage with a [UNK] jump aesthetically the madness of little emma really shines the binding of isaac has some of my favorite concepts for bosses the cage the [UNK] and even though ive only seen [UNK] bosses and enemies as of the writing of this review emma does a fantastic job of being more creepy and less cartoony the mass of [UNK] that can be found on the third floor that make that wonderfully creepy sound when they split and the first chapter boss the [UNK] that [UNK] around [UNK] with that horrific smile think that weird distorted [UNK] picture are two of my favorite examples the dark color palette looks great and i love what little ive heard of the soundtrack thus far all in all the madness of little emma is a fun little game that im definitely glad i bought i wont say that its better or worse than isaac ill just say its a fun standalone roguelike that i would definitely recommendi was on the fence for [UNK] on this one im going thumbs down [UNK] dont we get a scale 15 or something steam [UNK] its like the creator wanted to make binding of isaac but that was already done play in a series of increasingly deep basement rooms and floors check lots of random powerups that can have [UNK] effects check big boss to fight at the end of the floor check body [UNK] as weapons check treasure chests coins and bombs check shops with undead [UNK] check sad and creepy back story and enviroment check to be fair the creator has said she was inspired by tboi but i just dont find this game as fun some things i dont like your main weapon is [UNK] yes you happily spit at your enemies not the sad tears of tboi to me this is just weird your shot range is about 14 the screen [UNK] but enemy shots fly across the entire room this cannot be improved at least that ive seen so far except by one or two powerups you can get hit by an enemy that died eight seconds ago edit [UNK] addition a consequence of the previous point if the shot doesnt move very quickly happens with some enemy types or at all the shot will stay on the screen for a very long time beyond all reason waiting for you to touch it tboi is played as a topdown view of rooms [UNK] is played as a side view of rooms with platforms jump jump jump i dont find this fun maybe you will fcking spikes everywhere you can prevent damage if you jump up from them quickly once after that they are extended good luck getting past them half the treasures are spike puzzles or you just cant get them unless you want to die for them to compensate for all the spikes there is a ghost character [UNK] that can fly and shoot through some barriers and is not affected by spikes this character has some limitations such as increased damage received but i cant seem to enjoy playing with any other character edit add [UNK] [UNK] can shoot ghost spit through most barriers unlike the [UNK] [UNK] she can also fly this [UNK] for the platform [UNK] required of other [UNK] but some of the items you pick up [UNK] her advantages eg bouncy spit prevents her normal ability to spit through barriers the enemies cant many other items are useless eg she can already fly so catching that item doesnt help hope you have that item catalog handy most rooms are too [UNK] to easily see the walls you can get stuck because you cant see the [UNK] wall stopping you while you are trying to get away from enemies did you die unexpectedly oh that slightly less black wall in the already [UNK] background was there items are just random and weird and often not helpful if you dont remember what the item does too bad eg the one that drops your fire rate really low there is a catalog but finding the item in the list before you touch it is not easy once you pick it up it becomes part of a separate list but too late if its bad edit add [UNK] the game seems to [UNK] hard with impossible a hard game would require more skill to succeed in but some rooms are just absolutely impossible bullet hell with bullets all moving at different speeds and your char speed is way too fast to reasonably maneuver in the tiny intervals between them or enemies with insane advantages im looking at you brown liquid sisters the occasional infuriating unexpected crash to desktop i was having a good game too the painful rare but [UNK] punishment of having your luck dropped to zero [UNK] reduced chance of bombs coins and hearts there is some interesting creativity to [UNK] it arena rooms give a reward after surviving a fight edit add [UNK] arena mode is a way to learn about many items that otherwise you only occasionally encounter sacrifice rooms give a reward for giving up health bombs and coins special and secret levels [UNK] dark tunnel space others creative enemy types even if most have [UNK] in tboi unique and consistent distinct art style good music buy it if tboi is not enough for you but get that one [UNK] me start out by saying ive had lots of fun playing this game and i still am this game has so many items and hidden rooms im still unlocking them and trying to figure out how everything works i can say hands down i would recommend this game to just about anyone its not a serious hard core game but its cute and unique in its own creepy way even though ive been played the game for a while now its not that repetitive at all each dungeon is completely unique offering different items bosses and secrets making each run really fun or just [UNK] 1010 great [UNK] roguelite game to sink some hours in is a challenge but fun to master i have yet to even see all the items yet and i look forward to finding more [UNK] played almost 50 hours of this game so i guess im [UNK] to review it its pretty great 8510 you should buy it the only thing i have against it is its difficulty despite played it for 50 hours ive only unlocked the first ending youd think id reach the others by now but nope whats particularly cruel to me is the ladder mechanic dying early in the game can make my ladder score go down by thousands of points which is a serious rage [UNK] it [UNK] experimentation and [UNK] rage the game does have a casual mode that allows you to play without touching the ladder score but that takes out the fun of trying to raise it and doesnt really reward [UNK] overall though the atmosphere story [UNK] is really good i give [UNK] greatly recommend the madness of little emma for anyone who likes roguelites and challenging games with tons of replayability i really like this game although heavily inspired it manages to be unique and inventive after playing a lot of [UNK] and getting a bit bored with it i found the madness of little emma to [UNK] the craving while not being just more of the same definitely worth the price too there is a surprising amount of content and a great deal of replay value it always feels exciting to figure out what an item does to finally kill a boss or to find yet another secret also i love the music not sure if i like the game visually but thats not what im here for there are so many good things about this game that it would be silly to judge it just by its looks which arent too bad [UNK] i played this game a few hours and i must say that its definitely worth the money addictive because you want to go further and find new items see new enemys etc good music nice design leaderboard i am currently place 25 only thing i dont like are the [UNK] things on the ground sometimes its a bit unfair to reach some treasure chests buy it imagine binding of isaac except as a platformer and you pretty much have this game unfortunately some aspects of a game dont work nearly as well in platformer form as it does legend of zelda style and it clearly shows in this game theres some original ideas its more [UNK] and if you want a roguelike that is a bit more dependent on skill rather than [UNK] this will fit the bill but expect a much greater difficulty than in isaac unfortunately that difficulty increase doesnt feel intentional spikes that seem to be meant to push up if you stand on them too long damaging you seem to switch to the stab state too quickly to really utilize this as a mechanic and you can easily get treasure screwed early on because of their placement similarly many of the items you can get are useless or actively [UNK] to your gameplay once i got flight and was like [UNK] [UNK] binding of isaac this was one of the best items you could get but in this one its actually awful and many of the traits you can get are like this great in isaac awful in a platformer while there were subpar items in isaac you could often make use of all of them in certain situations but some of the items in this game are legitimately just pointless to have around or only really [UNK] to your play like the flight option that has such a slow [UNK] time youre likely going to get hit if you didnt have to hold down spacebar to stay [UNK] it might have been a much more useful item beating the first chapter wasnt that hard but once i got to story 2 i couldnt progress much further as a cheap enemy [UNK] would generally destroy me similarly the pacing is a lot slower you cant just rush a backtrack like you can in isaac in short the difficulty spike is too much and frankly the difficulty spike rarely seemed fair the bosses seem to be well designed but the rooms themselves hardly and the story from what ive [UNK] original or [UNK] im unexpectedly impressed this game is actually really good pros like binding of isaac the powerups you get are very relevant and [UNK] unlike [UNK] imo the art looks really good little critters fill the rooms and bring them to life the music is also really good very reminiscent of boi also there are secrets galore the wiki is really lacking at the moment so a lot of things about the game feel like a mystery this is a plus to some and a con to other but i find it kind of refreshing that the game feels so [UNK] and new right now this is one of my favorite things about the game you can click on the menu to find out what items do you dont need to look up items in your [UNK] effects on a wiki the [UNK] [UNK] is super interesting cons these cons are all very very small [UNK] things the pros are a way bigger deal jumping feels a little too floaty to me becomes a [UNK] once you get used to it one of the bosses so far i think it was the [UNK] can get into situations where its impossible to dodge their attack this is very likely the players fault though hes too tall to jump over so if he charges you and you arent [UNK] right so that he charges horizontally then you cant dodge spikes come up a little too fast imo i am [UNK] to ever try grabbing chests on them because i always take [UNK] little roguelite cool concepts but gameplay is slippery and too [UNK] game with good procedural generation lots of endings unfortunately its very difficult to get every of [UNK] game is such a cool in it have a lot of mystery and for this i like it so much the soundtrack is great in it have and a lot of items which is [UNK] cool think in the [UNK] first i had a negative impression of this game due to the lack of controller configuration options but was contacted [UNK] developer who told me how to manually change the controller mapping through the steam files and now i can play the game just fine actually a very fun gamei changed my mind short version a game that combines elements of shooters like [UNK] and the [UNK] of [UNK] into a promising experience that needs some work the game is still improving and the developer is quick to respond to complaints with [UNK] even my former [UNK] review loads of content neat ideas under the hood but needs patience to work with and requires manually editing a config file to adjust control pad controls which isnt great but since i tweak my [UNK] scrolls ini files i cant really complain basically its a neat little game that i hope the developer continues to improve because its got lots of potential long version so i recently wrote a review for the madness of emma wherein i went a bit away from my usual review style and into [UNK] about one thing that bugged me and letting it ruin my experience thats not who i want to be although it apparently is who i am so lets see if in honor of new years and the [UNK] response from the developer i cant give a better review to be clear this is a complete [UNK] the current game feels more like a beta the features are there but they need some refinement and tweaking to get the negatives out of the way the main character looks a bit odd and seems to be doing the [UNK] sometimes when shooting the default gamepad controls are just not great and to fix them you have to edit a config file but thats really easy to do and you should probably play with keyboard and mouse anyway despite my personal [UNK] a lot of the environments feel kinda empty there are only two fullscreen resolution options and one of them is a resolution i havent seen since i lost my [UNK] so thats weird but dont stop reading there i have a lot of good things to say the developer responded to my original review within a couple hours to tell me how to fix my biggest issue the control scheme i love a developer who responds so quickly and with such grace to criticism so kudos there the game itself is pretty fun combining platforming with the roguelite formula that made binding of [UNK] amazing is a great idea and the game itself plays well the voice acting and opening scenes are creepy and very well done there is enormous variety to be found in this game with weapons powerups bosses and room designs moreso than a lot of similar projects overall the madness of little emma is unpolished it needs work and could do with better config options and some minor improvement to the pixel art its not perfect but who the hell cares its a fun dark romp that gets better the more you play it im still not convinced that its worth the 9 us asking price but if you can get it on sale you absolutely wont regret it im personally looking forward to continued updates they seem to hit about every other month which is a pretty good pace and i plan to log several more hours with the game give it a chance itll grow on [UNK] [UNK] this review due to some very helpful feedback from the developer see the comments on this review my initial post was done in a fit of annoyance because the keyboard control was too difficult for me and although the game [UNK] my controller on [UNK] the bindings were all wrong and i couldnt see any way to change them this has now been resolved again see comments and for me the game is much better with a controller honestly though just the simple fact that the developer was willing to respond [UNK] to someone [UNK] about a game that they paid [UNK] for in the [UNK] sale automatically makes this recommended the game itself is pretty good too though its a roguelike platformer with a lot of similarities to binding of isaac which is fine with me because [UNK] is one of my alltime favourite games there are unlockable characters 100s of passive and active pickups and [UNK] rooms which ive only scratched the surface of so far the platformer aspect does give it a different feel from boi and its not quite as polished as that game but its overall a very solid game ive played a lot of different roguelikes and this is one that i think ill be playing for quite a while to come tldr fun game awesome developer [UNK] game does [UNK] a lot from binding of isaac but that fact is misleading the game at its core is a hard bullet hell platformer and that quality is more important to the game than any similarities is has to isaac its also made with love even if its a bit rough around the edges i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes challenging platformers and bullet hell [UNK] sure i have a few hundred casual hours left out of this game for the few bucks i payed for it and while im not sure ive ever come close to beating it yet i love it its like a platformer version of binding of isaac which is awesome and unique enough to stand up on its own its also a lot more challenging too definitely worth it if you like roguelikes at [UNK] of all yes this game is a [UNK] rip off of binding of isaac even down to things such as music style boss names and shooting spit instead of tears does this mean its a bad game not at all if you enjoy boi you will most likely enjoy this game as well it has nice art style smart enemy ai and interesting level design not to mention plenty of items and secrets to explore i happened to get it on sale for 2 dollars which was a fantastic price and a good deal would i have purchased it at its regular price most likely not i would have just stuck with playing binding of isaac however if youve 100 [UNK] isaac and are looking for very similar tribute game this is a good choice and is probably the best isaac clone i have played so far obviously if you were not a fan of boi dont get this game my main complaint about it is the controls while you are allowed to change the key bindings aiming and firing is strictly locked to the mouse which makes playing this game difficult if i am not at home with a physical mouse i can attach to my laptop if you dont have a physical mouse it makes the game basically unplayable it would also be nice if it had xbox controller compatibility however a simpler fix would just be to allow the firing and aiming to be [UNK] to the keyboard as it is in boi creating a smoother gaming experience final conclusion tired of playing boi or finished with it and want something similar and engaging get this game otherwise wait for it to go on sale again or skip itthis game plays similar to games like [UNK] and [UNK] 2d one hand on wasd to move and another on the mouse to shoot and it manages to keep the same feel as binding of isaac though it doesnt end up with your character looking widely different from what you started with if youre [UNK] older graphics cards avoid running the game in fullscreen itll crash like no [UNK] whoever made this game made sure no one will enjoy it its ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult the way the story unfolds is amazing and for those who say its a knockoff of the binding of isaac i think its much better however it needs more work done a lot of things dont make any sense im certain if the developer takes the suggestions from the players and improves it a lot of people will enjoy [UNK] the madness of little emma solid game still has some kinks to work out but definitely enjoyable very difficult and requires more practice than ive yet put in im not going to do a [UNK] list but if you want to hear my extended thoughts on the game i made a little video you can watch [UNK] premise of the game is good but thats where it ends there its [UNK] by a lot of trail and error and im not just describing playing the game and losing and trying again when you start the game youll get a keyboard showing the controls however youll later encounter various objects which could be used but then how would i use them the [UNK] screen doesnt explain that i had to find that out in the options tab maybe [UNK] to shoot but youll encounter the tiny creatures like the spiders and flies but they cant be shot at they can however be run into which kills them in a gross way which is confusing then there are the floor boards which have a [UNK] texture on them but they turn out to be spikes which harm the characters also trial and error collecting some items as they harm you which seems pointless a little too late type of mechanic not really nice the game offers an item gallery which displays all the items youve found in the menu but its just for show would have been nice if this was made for in game just in case the player encounters the same items [UNK] the best roguelike on steam i would say a cross between the [UNK] type platformer with the rest influenced from binding of isaac and it works very well tons of powerups great music and the random generation does a great job [UNK] bought this on sale because the reviews were screaming isaac clone my logic was that i love the binding of isaac enough that id love a clone [UNK] logic would rather be playing [UNK] game is simply awesome i will write this one clearly it is inspired to the binding of isaac or our darker purpose both wonderful games btw the same way salt and [UNK] is inspired to dark souls so please do not [UNK] the game calling it a copy of tboi or [UNK] there are a lot of brilliant and original ideas that made me like this game even more than tboi like secret stages a lot of details and fluff and obviously the plot itself you think that im bs you just buy it on sale no [UNK] for a couple of [UNK] you like isaac youre gonna like this game i havent played much but i am already so excited to see what the future will bring all those items i havent collected yet boy i cant wait to find out what they are this basically isaac but platformer the only downside is that the bosses which ive seen so far are kind of boring and easily figured out without much to them but thats only a small complaint very good game love it so [UNK] game is a hidden gem it released late december in 2015 and so far as of the writing of this review doesnt seem to have gotten much attention i only found out about it because i was digging through steam suggestions based on games similar to another roguelike and was suprised there was so little information about it anywhere considering how good it is it clearly gets inspiration from binding of isaac but its a sidescroller if you like isaac youll probably like this too seriously imagine isaac as a sidescroller and you have this if that concept sounds interesting to you like it did to me then get [UNK] wont be disappointed its not just a binding of isaac clone though this game takes an entirely different set of skills and has its own kind of charm to it its has a bit of a learning curve especially if youre used to the top down perspective i found the game quite difficult but once i got used to the controls and being in a 2d environment it felt a little more forgiving except those goddamn spikes thankfully the author is very active and helpful and constantly updates and works on improving the game even going as far as writing a [UNK] to help people figure out certain aspects of the game in the end im very happy i purchased this game and i hope it gets a lot more attention than it has so far it really deserves itthis game is fun but it feels so unpolished the last update was over a year ago and it seems like the dev no longer is working on it it just feels incomplete because of that i cant recommend it despite how much fun it [UNK] is not just an isaac ripoff its an isaac ripoff that pits everyone against each other in [UNK] ladder mode where people chase after 1 like its a [UNK] [UNK] golden ticket and then sit on it [UNK] their [UNK] in the [UNK] of the circle of attention for all to see i was in that circle of attention for about 2 weeks and it was [UNK] amazing until some hardcore [UNK] [UNK] came along and [UNK] me now just a handful of months later the current high score is closing in on twice my high score as 1 games that do not make you feel differently arent games [UNK] made me feel three separate emotions during different periods of my playing it good bad good about feeling good im okay with all of that i wish more games impacted me that [UNK] when i first saw this little gem i watched the trailer video thing and the movement looked kinda weird and floaty but then a sale [UNK] and i went ahead and got this gamethis is actually really fun and the controls are really tight i would [UNK] pick it up if you like [UNK] i want start off saying there isnt much wrong with this game technically but little things keep adding up in my brain this game is trying hard to be exactly like the binding of [UNK] and in [UNK] fails ive fought several bosses that i instantly [UNK] in their design and ability from [UNK] from the [UNK] stats to the gameplay is all trying so hard to be like [UNK] and it really shows hell youre [UNK] shoots orbs [UNK] of her mouth in place of tears i cant tell though if its trying to ripoff [UNK] or trying to be like it but for me the comparisons are so obvious that its not an homage now having said that fans of [UNK] will find something to enjoy in this game but the problem is if you [UNK] [UNK] you might as well just play that instead of this game the two are very similar in their [UNK] but one is just better at what it does but it being cheap at 9 makes it hard to say dont buy this game youre not losing much if you dont enjoy and at most you will enjoy cause its [UNK] solid roguelite platformer if you want all or most of the achievements you will have to play a lot of runs and hope rng is on your side some are very rng reliant and you will only know if you have a chance at them half way or more through a [UNK] is an incredible game the comparisons to isaac rogue legacy and [UNK] are certainly [UNK] but thats not necessarily a bad thing as someone who has well over 500 hours in isaac and a good amount of hours in rogue legacy i can say with pretty heavy [UNK] that emma does its comparisons justice it keeps it fresh with new items and large amount of achievements so everything is always a little bit different having your level of madness [UNK] the difficulty of the game is an interesting touch and the everything in [UNK] isaac reference yet again change after beating false end for the first time is nice as well after [UNK] or so hours i have yet to be bored by the game and every run is as different exciting and [UNK] as the last if not moreso i look forward to progressing even farther in the game as i traverse through dungeon after dungeon of both literal and [UNK] misery tldr this game is amazing buy it if you like roguelikes and [UNK] game is amazing its a 2d side scrolling version of binding of isaac with better weapons i never felt cheated by cheap kills like binding of isaac does this game is fun and challenging its worth the 5 price [UNK] game is similar to the binding of isaac thematically and mechanically if you name a feature in isaac and ask if its in emma the answer is probably yes the main difference mechanically is that its an occasionally tense bullet hell platformer the main difference thematically is that theres no poop hopefully neither of those are [UNK] for you because everything that makes isaac [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] pacing unlockable characters and boss encounters tons of [UNK] [UNK] game does just as well between the two i think emma is a little more [UNK] and challenging in isaac youre sometimes able to become a [UNK] being of destruction that clears boss fights instantly and so far at least emma is a little less forgiving if you put any significant amount of time into isaac or [UNK] youll be happy i got it while it was on sale but the [UNK] price point is still a good [UNK] reccomend it 100 without giving too much about it away the gameplay is exciting and challenging the art and music are fantastic theres a wonderfully done eerie atmosphere the controls are [UNK] and overall this is a really nice hidden gem on the steam store while its similarities to the binding of isaac are quite present youll be having so much fun playing the game that you wont even [UNK] got about 4 hours into the game and its just okay pros great boi adaptation if you like platforming and boi this is the game for you plenty of new pickups and characters to unlock and challenging to boot definitely a must if youre one of those [UNK] gamers cons very unbalanced the characters ive unlocked have pretty [UNK] starting stats and the game is super control [UNK] its difficult to drop bombs in the game i usually have to push the button 2 or 3 times and before you ask its not a hardware problem if you like a great challenge dont mind spending a few bucks and searching for the [UNK] patch its in the forums took me about 30 minutes to find it pick this one up but if youre one of those folks that get easily frustrated over mechanics and get gud scenarios stay away barely got a thumbs up from mei seem to be addicted to this game despite my frustration for how it just drops me into bullethell i find myself wanting more control over which powerups i receive and more opportunity for clever escape some rooms are [UNK] while others are pretty much impossible unless you have the right powerups of course frustrated but addicted is bad so i cannot recommend the gamethe madness of little emma is a good game however itll take you a while to [UNK] start getting somewhere the madness of little emma is a game inspired by binding of isaac and takes a different approach on it by making it into a sidescrolling game is sidescrolling the right word here im not sure myself so please let me know if it isnt now as always lets start with the good stuff the story while it has a few similarities to boi which is prefer to call nod because theres only 2 noticeable one and theyre minor details is very unique and intriguing however i cannot say anything about the ending as i have yet to reach them the game is easy to grasp you shoot at enemies with left click to kill them and you place bombs with right click to break walls and other objects or just blow up enemies however being able to effectively [UNK] enemies and survive for more than 3 floors is where the game starts [UNK] difficult so if youve never played a game like this before youll suck for quite a while the music isnt anything special imo but it works really well with the grim tone the game has while this is all great i have a few issues with this game such a game should have some sort of wiki which it does not however the game is less than a month old and the community is pretty small so i can understand it not having a wiki yet the game becomes repetitive really quickly [UNK] of the small collection of items and the fact that theres only one character and for a game that can take a while to get good at that is not a good thing all in all the game is fun but id say that the game currently costs a bit too much for what it has as of right now final rating [UNK] the binding of [UNK] its a platformer its a great idea but unfortunately poorly executed sorry i wanted this to succeed but it just didnt click for [UNK] this on [UNK] sale pretty good but nothing too special its alright but its not that fun after you beat the normal game ive only played arena after that still good [UNK] looks like a fun platformer but the controls make it nearly impossible to play it uses an fps layout in the sense of wasd to move and the mouse aims this seems [UNK] for this type of 2d game in my mind the [UNK] controller support tag didnt seem to be accurate in my case either if youre cool with keyboard mouse for this kind of game you might enjoy it [UNK] rogue like game with score ladder [UNK] ending that are hard to get really cool game give a [UNK] game is literally unplayable i had to restart steam to boot another game because steam thought it was open but it wasnt and it wasnt in task manager nice i also remember it being bad when i bought it ages ago so probably just dont buy this lolthis game has some of the worst controls i have seen in a 2d sidescroller controller mapping is broken and unintuitive cant remap the controls keyboard and mouse controls are kinda delayed the shots dont fly where the cursor is its slightly off not being able to control the character is a major problem and absolutely not worth buying even for 2 bucks binding of isaac if binding of isaac was a platformer and not good like binding of isaac but extremely slow and tedious im still looking for a good isaac style [UNK] so how did no one mention there is no fullscreen like really this the full release of the game with no fullscreen or decent controller support its not even good its just boi but with bad controls i dont get why people are [UNK] this gamethe madness of little emma is one of those games that was compared to another in this case the binding of [UNK] and that caused me to skip it for a while luckily i ended up picking this up on [UNK] during a sale and i have found that i like it a lot now there are some [UNK] to [UNK] in that you have a character with a tragic backstory going a bit crazy a plethora of characters to choose from randomly generating maps and loads of items you can collect the thing that [UNK] it is that it becomes its own game as you play with everything from the sidescrolling layout to the types of items keeping you wanting to play as far as layout goes you have a map on the top of the screen that shows you where you are and all [UNK] rooms it also tracks your progress and it keeps a rudimentary tab on some items you miss it will not for example tell you that you missed a treasure chest but it will [UNK] you that you left coins or a heart behind this helps a lot too and especially when you are hurt you have specific [UNK] on the [UNK] side that can be powered up in a few ways with these basically controlling your strength how fast you shoot and your luck along with that you have hearts that showcase your health and that are removed in [UNK] or [UNK] on the enemy when it comes to attacking you have the left click shot and the right [UNK] different characters impact this differently for example you can unlock a little ghost girl that can shoot through walls still this is basic in a good way meaning you do not have to worry about convoluted controls the room layout has a few options from the randomly spawned enemy rooms to rooms with games of chance challenges rooms to spend coins or hearts sometimes and bonus rooms there is at least one bonus room per level so you basically get an item for winning each time there are also rip rooms wherein you pick up a large item as well as far as what you can find here you have 100s of items that you can get and that can be stacked on top of one another so you can become more and more powerful as you roam the game for example you may find a cloud that causes all your enemies to stick to it and a hat that gives you spikes if attacked from behind you may find bugs to surround and protect you or an assault raven that hits baddies you can also get shot upgrades giving you bomb shots stronger ones stun ones and on there are loads of enemies in the game too giving you a variety of things to run into from the basic [UNK] that get in the way to the more complex enemies that shoot lightning or teleport you have things to figure out and [UNK] the bosses also come in a variety of forms from flying to those that spawn little [UNK] to snakes and the like i like the boss fights because they are straight forward there is a bar across the top [UNK] the boss health in read take it and you win there are also two modes of play you can play the ladder wherein you can see other peoples scores and compete by adding onto yours this [UNK] and does not go game by game or you can play casual i like this game quite a bit it can be a good way to kill a few minutes or to set for an hour or [UNK] have over 900 hours on binding of isaac and i can easily say its my favorite game madness of little emma does a fantastic job bringing back the love i have for isaac since i started to play the level of difficulty can be comparable and the learning curve is the same i hate to say it but to me its binding of isaac 2 with improvements its a worthy pick up and certainly worth the current price on steam i have as i write this about an hour and can very [UNK] say i found a new favorite game if you like boi get thisi love the graphics and story i wasnt expecting such a good short prologue that really got into the head of a girl losing her mind its a hard [UNK] satisfying i will say the movement of the character feels a little fast to me but thats my only [UNK] started playing this with [UNK] thinking i could not possibly enjoy how rough around the edges it seemed now i cant stop playing it it scratches the itch of playing one more time to [UNK] that hope of getting a proper build and finishing a playthrough just right amount of frustration very little resources for figuring things out but thats [UNK] game has a lot to offer for a small price tag it goes very cheap during steam sales and i was able to pick it up for 8 and oh man is it worth that pricei honestly got more out of this game then i expected to bought it on sale and it filled the itch that i needed to scratch for an easy to pick up but challenging to master roguelike i think this game is very fun for the genre you can tell the [UNK] put a large amount of time into balancing the game and all the different items in it well worth the money spent for the hours i [UNK] binding of isaac but a platformer fun and actually difficult play it its funthis game is a gem at first i thought to expect a clone of the binding of isaac but it really excels in many ways and is a lot more fun to me the art style is fitting the music fits the mood of the game really well the game can sometimes be extremely difficult to excel and sometimes easy all depending on what toys you can find in each play through overall its a great game to play if you like action strategy and especially platformer games 810i havent played much of this game but i am already [UNK] binding of isaac but platformer i [UNK] game is terrible please dont spend money in [UNK] of isaac appreciation [UNK] game is kinda [UNK] spikes are gay and ruin [UNK] buy it play it enjoy [UNK] written on [UNK] [UNK] than [UNK]

You want to hit in the center of the model, you know, the empty space between the masts where the cannonballs would pass right through. If you hit the right spot it can take as few as two hits to sink them. Otherwise you can't kill them fast enough. Aim close to the most forward point of the bow and slightly towards the background from there.\\r\\n(Not recommended because it's not very exciting after a couple tries, and not fun until you figure out exactly where to aim.)\"\n",
